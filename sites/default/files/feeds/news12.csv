"משלחת איגוד המוזאונים בשנחאי, סין, נובמבר 2010","דוח כינוס בין-לאומי, הוועידה התלת-שנתית של איקום בשנחאי, סין
13-7 בנובמבר 2010
מאת עידית שרוני – אוצרת מוזאון יהדות בבל, אור-יהודה
 
הכינוס התקיים בשנחאי, סין בתאריכים 13-7 בנובמבר, 2010 בבניין האקספו העולמי. בכינוס השתתפו למעלה מאלפיים עמיתים מכל תחומי המוזאולוגיה מרחבי העולם.
נושאו של הכינוס – ""מוזאונים עבור הרמוניה חברתית"" (Museums for Social Harmony) ומטרתו להבהיר את תפקיד המוזאון כמקדם התפתחות חברתית וכמתווך בקונפליקטים תרבותיים וסביבתיים.
במסגרת הוועידה הכללית של איקום התקיים כינוס של ארגון איקמה (ICME) – הוועידה הבינלאומית של מוזאונים אתנוגרפים, אשר דן בנושא –  ""המוזאון המאתגר ואתגור המוזאון""(The Challenging Museum/Challenging the Museum).
מוזאונים אתנוגרפים שמציגים מורשת תרבותית, הולכים ומתפתחים ברבות השנים והם נותנים תרומה חשובה בבניית הרמוניה חברתית. התפתחות זו ניכרת בסין אשר עושה מאמצים לשמר את קבוצות המיעוט האתני החיות בקרבה. הרצאה מרתקת בנושא זה ניתנה מאת Yong Jirong מסין בנושא – Development and Challenges of Ethnic Cultural and Regional Museums In China
ההרצאה דנה בתפתחות המוזיאונים לאתנוגרפיה בסין בתחילת המאה העשרים, אשר להם תפקיד חשוב בקידום הרמוניה חברתית. סין, אשר מתרחשים בה שינויים עמוקים בחברה ובכלכלה, ניצבת מול אתגרים חסרי תקדים בשימור המורשת התרבותית של חמישים ושש קבוצות אתניות. הממשלה עושה מאמצים בשימור הקבוצות ובונה מוזיאונים אתניים, במיוחד במחוזות עם אוכלוסיית מיעוט אתני.
""מוזיאון יהדות בבל"" עלה בהרצאתה של ד""ר שלי שנהב – Visual Politics & Poetic Ethnography in Ethnic Heritage Centers in Israel בהקשר של מרכזי מורשת בארץ. אציין כי המשך הדיון על מוזיאון יהדות בבל התקיים במפגשים עם עמיתים במהלך הכנס שביקשו לשאול אותי שאלות נוספות על המוזיאון ואופי פעילותיו.
Per Rekdal מנורבגיה דיבר בהרצאתו –The Challenging Museum/Challenging the Museum על התעוזה במוזיאונים להעלות דילמות ופרדוקסים. תעוזה זו לדבריו מאתגרת את המוזיאון. דוגמא למוזיאון שמתמודד עם נושא מאתגר עלתה בהרצאה של Ann Siri מנורבגיה – Minda, the girl at the pharmacy  - An educational programme on sexual assault
המוזיאון יצא עם תוכנית חינוכית שעוסקת בנושא של תקיפה מינית. סיפור אמיתי על ילדה בת ארבע עשרה בשם מינדה אשר הותקפה מינית על ידי בעל בית מרקחת, אשר יצא זכאי בשל חוסר הוכחות. זהו סיפור של מאבק שמעלה את פער המעמדות בין ילדה שבאה ממעמד פועלים לבין בעל בית מרקחת שבא ממעמד גבוה. התוכנית במוזיאון מועברת באמצעות תיאטרון אשר שחקניו הם קהל הילדים במוזיאון אשר שופט את המקרה.
במהלך הכנס נערך סיור בבית הכנסת ""אוהל משה"" שמשמש היום כמוזיאון לפליטים יהודים בשנחאי. עם פרוץ מלחמת העולם השנייה, הגיעו לסין כ-18,000 פליטים יהודים ממרכז אירופה, שברחו מאימת הנאצים. פליטים אלו הגיעו לשנחאי, שהיה המקום היחיד שלא דרש מהם ויזה. הקהילה הספרדית והקהילה האשכנזית דאגו לפליטים ששוכנו בגטו הונגקיו בשנחאי. עשירי הקהילה הבגדאדית נרתמו לסייע לפליטים ותרמו כספים לשיפוץ בניינים ולבניית מרפאות ובית ספר לילדי הפליטים. מבחינתי מצאתי עניין רב בבית כנסת זה הן בשל הצגת סיפור הצלתם של הפליטים היהודים והן בשל מעורבותה של הקהילה הבגדאדית בסיפור זה. אחת מויטרינות התצוגה במוזיאון הוקדשה לפריטים של יהודי בגדאד בשנחאי, שם התבקשתי על-ידי צוות המוזיאון לדבר על טיבם של הפריטים של הקהילה הבגדאדית שמוצגים שם. חוויית הביקור התעצמה כאשר נכנסנו, עם כיסוי ניילון לנעלינו, לחלל בית הכנסת ששוחזר על ידי הממשלה הסינית בשנת 2007.
 
חשיבותה של הקהילה היהודית הבגדאדית בשנחאי
אל הכנס הגעתי כחודש לאחר פתיחת התערוכה שאצרתי במוזיאון יהדות בבל ""מעולפת ספירים""[*]: ספרי תורה ותשמישי קדושה בקהילות יהודי בבל בבבל ובתפוצות. התערוכה מציגה, בין השאר, היכל ותיבה אותנטיים שקיבלנו ממשפחת ששון, ספרי תורה שנוצרו בבבל ובסין ותצלומי בתי כנסת במזרח הרחוק לרבות בית כנסת ""אוהל רחל"" בשנחאי.
בתערוכה בולטת חשיבותן של משפחות בגדאדיות, במיוחד משפחת ששון שכונתה ""הרוטשילדים של המזרח"", שהיגרו למזרח הרחוק והתיישבו שם ובכלל זה בשנחאי. השתתפותי בכנס שנערך בעיר שנחאי הייתה עבורי סגירת מעגל מרתקת.
היישוב היהודי החדש בסין התחיל באמצע המאה ה-19 על-ידי יהודים יוצאי בגדאד ויהודי בבל בהודו שהיו סוחרים אמידים. הם התיישבו בשנחאי ותרמו תרומה ניכרת להפיכתה של עיר זו מעיירת דייגים לעיר בין-לאומית. תוך זמן קצר תפסו משפחות בגדאדיות בולטות כמו ששון, כדורי, חרדון  ועזרא מקום מרכזי במסחר ובכלכלה של העיר וצברו עושר רב מעסקי נדל""ן ומסחר באופיום. כך לדוגמא, חלקים רבים של הרחוב הראשי בשנחאי - רח' ננג'ין, היו שייכים במקור לחרדון; ""מלון שלום"" – מלון מפואר שבמקור נקרא ""מלון קטאי"", נבנה על-ידי ויקטור ששון. הוא ממוקם ברחוב ננג'ין הנושק לבונד - הטיילת המפורסמת ביותר בעיר על גדות נהר ההוואנג-פו; ארמון הילדים המפורסם בשנחאי היה בעבר ארמון השיש של משפחת כדורי ועוד.
התמזל מזלי והצלחתי לערוך סיור בבית הכנסת ""אוהל רחל"", אשר אינו פתוח לקהל בימים אלה. בית כנסת זה הינו גדול ממדים ומרשים, נבנה בשנת 1920 על-ידי סר יעקב ששון לזכר אשתו רחל, ברובע הבריטי בשנחאי.
אני מודה לפרופסורים מ""המרכז ללימודים יהודים בשנחאי"", איתם ערכתי פגישה מקצועית. שם נפגשתי גם עם פרופ' פאן גואנג שהוציא קטלוג על היהודים בשנחאי והוא אף הרצה בכנס. הם עשו מאמצים רבים אשר צלחו וכך הייתה לי הזכות להתרשם מקרוב ולהיכנס לבית הכנסת, ששימש כמרכזם של הקהילה הבגדאדית בשנחאי כמאה שנים.
ברצוני להודות לאיקום ישראל אשר אפשרו לי לקחת חלק בכנס המעשיר. הייתה זו חוויה מקצועית אשר הרחיבה את הידע המוזיאלי נוסף לחוויה האישית. חשיבותו של הכנס הוא גם במתן האפשרות ליצור קשרים עם עמיתים מוזיאולוגים מכל העולם ובכלל זה עם פרופסורים סינים מ""המרכז ללימודים יהודים בשנחאי"" שחוקרים את יהודי בגדאד בעיר מרתקת זו.

"הוועידה הבין-לאומית השלישית למורשת ופיתוח בר-קיימא, פורטוגל 2012","Heritage 2012, 3rd International Conference on Heritage and Sustainable Development follows the path of the previous editions: it aims at establishing a state of the art event regarding the relationships between forms and kinds of heritage and the framework of sustainable development concepts.  Environment, economics, society and culture, the four dimensions of sustainable development, are brought here to define a singular approach on how to deal and go beyond the traditional aspects of heritage preservation and safeguarding. On our today's world, heritage is no longer just a memory or a cultural reference, or even a place or an object. Heritage is moving towards broader and wider scenarios, where it becomes often the driven forces for commerce, business, leisure and politics. HERITAGE 2012 is a peer reviewed conference.

מידע בעניין כינוס מוזאונים לזכויות אזרח,"In 2010 National Museums Liverpool (NML) coordinated the establishment of a new international museum initiative called the Federation of International Human Rights Museums (FIHRM). The inaugural conference was held at the International Slavery Museum, Liverpool. Almost 100 delegates from more than 20 countries, including Colombia, Lithuania, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria and South Africa, attended the event, a number of whom received dedicated bursaries.
 
The conference ran under the patronage of UNESCO, and delegates discussed ways in which museums and institutions tackle and challenge racism, discrimination and human rights abuses. Feedback has been hugely positive and confirmed the timely nature of this initiative. We have uploaded the papers of the conference onto the FIHRM website, and there is also a resources page which includes teaching and education materials, as well as international case studies on human rights and campaign work from museums, NGOs and related organisations.
 
Based on the success of the inaugural conference, we are pleased to announce the second FIHRM conference, which will take place at the International Slavery Museum from the 10-13 October 2011.  NML will continue to lead the initiative, with support from the FIHRM Council, which is made up of leading international institutions, including the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, Te Papa in New Zealand and the South African Holocaust Foundation.
 
We would be delighted to see you at the conference in Liverpool in October. For more information, visit www.fihrm.org <http://www.fihrm.org/>  or contact Abby Wringe, FIHRM Coordinator on

Mellon Foundation, and early planning-grant funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Folklore Society developed the Thesaurus in cooperation with the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. AFS thankfully recognizes the dedicated work of the Thesaurus editorial board, the IU-B Libraries, and the IU Digital Library Program to transfer the AFSET to its new home. This work has strengthened Open Folklore as a direct provider of useful tools for folklore studies and related fields, as well as a search-and-discovery tool for online content available elsewhere. The current beta version incorporates the AFSET editorial board's revisions of the following facets: art, belief, dance, disciplines, entertainment and recreation, foodways, health, language, law and governance, material culture, music, performance, ritual, social dynamics, transmission, verbal arts, and literature. The editorial board will be completing the review of these remaining facets before launch of the AFSET 2.0 on October 1: general; beings; documentation; education; migration and settlement; research, theory and methodology; space and place; time; and work.

"קול קורא להגשת תקצירים לקראת הכינוס של  הוועדה לשימור מטעם איקו""ם, ריו דה-ז'נירו, אוגוסט 2013","ICOM-CC session at ICOM General Conference, Rio de Janeiro, August 10-17, 2013
 
The Committee for Conservation of the International Council of Museums (ICOM-CC) will hold a one-day lecture session during ICOM's General Conference in Rio de Janeiro.  Updated information about the program, registration, and hotels is available on the conference website: http://rio2013.icom.museum
 
The theme of ICOM-CC's session is The ""value"" of conservation in the twenty-first century
 
Conservation departments in museums, government ministries, and universities are everywhere under scrutiny by administrators seeking to cut costs by reducing, reorganizing, or completely eliminating them.  This session will focus on the value of conservation to society-how it is perceived and measured and how conservation professionals can influence the public perception of conservation through their actions and through better communication.  Papers (up to 20 minutes) are sought which explore this topic by addressing the following questions:
What is the perceived value of conservation to society?
What effect does the conservation of cultural heritage have on society at large?
What standards or benchmarks can be used to measure the value of conservation to society?
How much are governments/the public willing to spend on the conservation of cultural heritage and why?  What can conservation professionals do to increase investment in the conservation of cultural heritage?
In what ways can conservation professionals affect the perceived value of conservation through communication with our peers and/or public outreach?  How can conservation research assist in better understanding the value of conservation?
 
The session will be conducted in English.  The possibility of simultaneous translation into Portuguese is being investigated.
 
Museum professionals, including but not limited to those working in conservation, are invited to submit abstracts of up to 200 words related to the theme to Joan Reifsnyder, Secretary, ICOM-CC (secretariat@icom-cc.org<mailto:secretariat@icom-cc.org>) by March 15.  Submissions should include a title, author(s), institutional affiliation, corresponding author's email address, and 200-word abstract in English.
 
A panel consisting of ICOM-CC Chair Lisa Pilosi, Vice-Chair Vinod Daniel, and Directory Board member Johanna Maria Theile will select papers for presentation by the author(s) at ICOM-CC's session in Rio.  Authors will be notified by April 30.  Selected abstracts will be posted on the ICOM-CC website.
 
In addition to the lecture session, ICOM-CC is planning visits to conservation laboratories as well as other activities.  Updated information about these activities will be posted on the ICOM-CC website: www.icom-cc.org<http://www.icom-cc.org>.",04/02/2013 - 15:59,04/02/2013 - 15:59

"כינוס בנושא טקסט וטקסטיל, קמברידג', ספטמבר 2012","TEXTS AND TEXTILES A conference organised by the Centre for Material Texts, University of Cambridge to be held 11-12 September 2012 at Jesus College, Cambridge  The shared origin of 'text' and 'textile' in the Latin 'texere', 'to weave', is a critical commonplace. Many of the terms we use to describe our interactions with words are derived from this common linguistic root, and numerous other expressions associated with reading and writing are drawn from the rich vocabulary of cloth. Textiles are one of the most ubiquitous components of material culture, and they are also integral to the material history of texts. Paper was originally made from cotton rags, and in many different cultural and historical settings texts come covered, wrapped, bound, or decorated with textiles. And across the domestic, public, religious, and political spheres, textiles are often the material forms in which texts are produced, consumed, and circulated.  In the light of the CMT's current research theme on 'the material text in material culture', we invite papers which consider any of the many dimensions of the relationship between texts and textiles. There are no historical, geographical, or disciplinary limitations. Areas to be addressed could include:  The shared language of texts and textiles - construction and deconstruction: to weave, spin, stitch, knit, stitch, suture, tie up or together, piece, tailor, gather, fashion, fabricate, mesh, trim, stretch, wrap, unfold, unpick - challenges and problem-solving: knots, tangles, holes; to lose the thread, iron out creases, unravel, cut, keep on tenterhooks - pieces and fragments: rags, patches, patchwork, scraps, strands, threads, rhapsodies, patterns, seams, loose ends, layers  The stuff of books - bookbindings and covers - incunabula - 'swaddling clothes' - medieval girdle books, book chemises - paper and paper-making - cutting, sewing, and stitching in and on books - scrapbooks, albums, collages - book ribbons and bookmarks - carpet pages - textiles in illustrations, frontispieces, title pages  Textile texts - needlework and words: tapestry, embroidery, samplers, quilts, hangings, carpets, banners - the needle and the pen - printed textiles - sacred/religious texts and textiles - love-tokens, keepsakes, charms, and relics - cushions, badges, handkerchiefs, flags, scarves, uniforms, livery and other textual/textile ephemera - professional and amateur work - relationships and networks of gifts, patronage, exchange - pattern books, sample books, costume books  Proposals of up to 25O words for 20-minute papers should be sent to Jason Scott-Warren (jes1OO3@cam.ac.uk) and Lucy Razzall (lmfr2@cam.ac.uk) by 30 April 2012.  http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/**cmt/ <http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/cmt/>  --  Patrick Cox Editor, H-MATERIAL CULTURE PhD Student http://camden-rutgers.academia.edu/PatrickCox",15/02/2012 - 11:57,15/02/2012 - 11:57

ICOM publishes a new Emergency Red List: the Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk.
One year on from the events that took place in Egypt in 2011, ICOM's actions to protect the country's cultural heritage from the ensuing thefts of non-inventoried objects from archaeological sites and museums have led to the publication of the Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk.
 
The International Council of Museums (ICOM) announces the publication, at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation in Cairo (NMEC), on 6 February 2012 at 10 a.m., of a new Emergency Red List: the Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk. ICOM Director General, Julien Anfruns, officially presented the Emergency Red List, on this occasion, in the presence of the Director of the NMEC, Dr Mohammed Abdel Fatah. Julien Anfruns had an official meeting after the presentation with the Minister of State for Antiquities, Pr Mohammed Ibrahim Ali. Following this important event, a seminar on illicit traffic and Red Lists will take place on 7 February 2012 at 9 a.m., also at the NMEC.
 
The ICOM Red Lists are important, effective tools designed to help police and customs officials, heritage professionals and art and antiquities dealers identify the types of objects that are most susceptible to illicit trafficking and therefore subject to smuggling and illicit trade.
 
The Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk was made possible thanks to the generous support of the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.
 
This ICOM initiative was conducted in cooperation with its International Committee for Egyptology (CIPEG), and with the participation of national and international experts in archaeology and history and the Ministry of Antiquities of the Arab Republic of Egypt. It aims to raise awareness among the local population, law enforcement officials and the international art and antiquities market.

BACKGROUND
Armed conflicts world wide continue to involve deliberate or accidental damage to cultural heritage. Conflicts result in the weakening of governments and societies and endanger the core values that hold communities together. The protection and recovery of Cultural heritage can play a crucial role in rebuilding societies and in overcoming the sense of loss and displacement.
Notwithstanding, in times of conflict, any operation will be delayed as ensuring security and safety of people takes precedence.  As a result, it is essential for the concerned professionals working in these areas to understand how and when to intervene to secure or recover cultural heritage while law enforcement, peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts are under way. The course therefore, will provide participants with the necessary skills and knowledge to analyze a conflict; understand its underlying causes; its manifestations including its impact on cultural heritage and identify various actors who could be involved in protecting cultural heritage.
 
OBJECTIVES
- Analyze patterns in present-day conflicts, especially in relation to their interactions with cultural heritage
- Explore the values associated with cultural heritage and the impact that conflict has on them
- Assess and manage risks to cultural heritage in conflict situations
- Secure, salvage and stabilize a variety of cultural materials
- Take peacetime preparatory action to improve response in times of conflict
- Critically examine the applicability of international legal instruments, and of conservation ethics and principles in times of conflict
- Communicate successfully with the various actors involved, and work in teams
 
METHODOLOGY        
The course will comprise group activities, interactive lectures, practical sessions, simulations, site visits and case studies. Participants will be asked to develop case studies drawing from their own experience and work context. 
 
PARTICIPANTS
The course is aimed at those who are actively involved in the protection of cultural heritage within a variety of institutions (libraries, museums, archives, sites, departments of antiquities or archaeology, religious and community centres, etc.). It is also aimed at professionals from humanitarian and cultural aid organizations, as well as military, civilian and civil defense personnel. Those with experience in conflict situations are particularly encouraged to apply. A maximum of 22 participants will be selected.

"הוועידה השנתית של ICTOP, הוועדה להכשרת אנשי מקצוע באיקו""ם, ספטמבר 2012, אמסטרדם","ICTOP Call for Papers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands-Sept. 13-15, 2012
 
ICTOP, the ICOM International Committee for the Training of Personnel invites papers for the ICTOP annual conference to be held in Amsterdam Sept. 13-15 2012. Our meeting this year will be hosted by the Reinwardt Academy for Cultural Heritage, Amsterdam, School of the Arts. This international meeting will focus on the theme of “Bridges and Boundaries: Reframing Professional Education for Museums + Heritage?”
We invite proposals for paper presentations of 15 minutes, multi-paper panels, virtual papers by video or other modes of communication, which analyse current and emerging issues in the field of museum professional development.
 
Presentations should examine how professional development education is or is not shifting from a variety of global perspectives and the implications for the conceptualization of our museums/heritage sector and professional preparation.
As an interdisciplinary field, museology/museum studies crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, especially as new needs, emphases and professions emerge. This leaves the boundaries of our profession, its study and delivery unclear at best. But then where and when do we identify new fields for naming our offerings? In some parts of the world, for example, museum studies/museology programs have been extended to include heritage studies in their title or content. The broader term ‘heritage’ may seem like a solution to our vague definitions of the ‘museum’ but does the term ─ and its field ‘heritage studies’ ─ bring more problems than it solves? Presenters may wish to address how prevalent (or not) this trend is across the globe or speak to specific cases as we reflect on the general implications for the field, programs of prof. education and curriculum/a developments.
 
A few questions to consider:
 
1       Is there a genuine shift in concepts and the profession or a pragmatic move that responds to governmental policy and job opportunities?
2       What are the challenges for museology programmes, or other developers, in adopting wider definitions such as that of heritage?
3       Are there other tendencies in our pedagogy representing either the voices of traditional or new disciplines ─ such as cultural studies, management, curatorial studies, gallery studies, informatics ─ or emerging topics or issues ─ such as development, sustainability, inclusion, career planning and employability ─ that are compelling changes?
4       Where is the sector/profession in this discussion?
5       What guidelines or competencies might be needed in this complex situation?
 
Submissions can be:

"הוועידה השנתית של CAMOC מטעם איקו""ם, ונקובר קנדה, אוקטובר 2012","CALL FOR PAPERS
Theme: City Museums: Collisions I Connections
CAMOC 2012 Annual Conference / Museum of Vancouver British Columbia, Canada
October 24-26, 2012
 
CAMOC, the International Committee for the Collections and Activities of Museums of Cities of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), in collaboration with the Museum of Vancouver, invites papers for *“City
Museums: Collisions I Connections”*, *a conference on city museums and their engagement in city life* to be held at the Museum of Vancouver, October 24-26, 2012. We are soliciting panels, presentations (15 minutes in length), virtual exhibitions/apps, films, and other presentations about city museums.
There will be a poster competition for delegates to present case studies of projects from their museums addressing one of the conference themes. We would be happy to consider and accommodate other sorts of presentation methods as well.**
 
CAMOC is “a forum for people who work in or are interested in museums about cities, urban planners, historians, economists, architects or geographers, all of whom together can share knowledge and experience, exchange ideas and explore partnerships across international boundaries.”
http://camoc.icom.museum/index2.php The Museum of Vancouver is Canada’s largest urban history museum focusing on the life of a city.
http://www.museumofvancouver.ca/
 
The conference will bring people together to talk about how city museums are reconsidering their role in civic life due to the enormous pressure cities face in terms of aging infrastructure, the need for urban regeneration, economic and environmental crises, and social issues such demographic shifts, global diasporas, increasing immigrant and urban Aboriginal populations. The conference will look at city museums under development, urban/suburban city museums, and city museums in large and small cities.
 
Under the wider rubric of the conference theme, suggested sub-topics
include:
 
·      *Defining the 21st century city museum: the changing role of the
city museum today*
 
o   City museum as urban forum and dialogue centre
 
o   City museum as agency for urban development
 
o   City museums and city branding
 
 
 
·      *Cities and museums: collisions/connections/contemporary expectations
*
 
o   Measuring the social value of city museums: inspirations and
challenges. In times of financial instability, museums need to prove their social value as collection repositories, as contact zones between people and communities, as educational resources for society at large, as boosters for the cultural and tourist industry, as generators of powerful multi-sensory experiences, as agents of social harmony and stability
 
o   Furthering understanding and fostering social cohesion and connections
among people (immigrants/migrants, long-term residents & Aboriginal
communities)
 
o   Changing demographics in today’s cities, ensuring the present and
future relevance of city museums by changing whose stories are collected and told, and how museums work with communities
 
o   Contributing to community development and well-being: engaging in
issues such as literacy, poverty, youth at risk, etc.
 
o   Reducing isolation in communities: creating a sense of place & identity
 
o   Providing economic impact: how effective are city museums becoming
destinations and revitalizing downtown cores?
 
o   Understanding the impact of new museum roles on museum staff
 
o   Inviting museum professional to consider how city museums either learn
from, or offer a model for, other urban museums in their changing relationships to their urban setting.
 
The conference will have several components: 1) formal papers; 2) site visits to urban and suburban museums; 3) poster competition (details to
follow) and exhibit area for museums to share their work; 4) a roundtable discussion by invitation for museologists and urbanists to share and elaborate on the definitions of the 21st century City Museums and the interim results of the “City Museums Database” project.
 
CAMOC is pleased to have international consultant Larry Beasley, one of the world’s best urban planners, as a keynote speaker. The former Director of Planning for the City of Vancouver, he led the revitalization of neighborhoods, a strong heritage preservation program, and the city’s urban design studio.
 
Social events will be announced as they are confirmed. If there is sufficient interest, a post-conference tour will be arranged.
 
Interested participants, whether panel chairs or authors of individual papers, should send a proposal of 300–500 words accompanied by a 200-word biography by April 15, 2012 to:

"""דת בתנועה"" נושא הוועידה ה-10 של SIEF קבוצת עבודה לאתנוגרפיה ולדת, סגד - הונגריה, ספטמבר 2012","Religion on the Move: How Motion and Migration Influence Religion   10th Conference of the SIEF Working Group on Ethnology of Religion  Szeged, Hungary 12-14 September, 2012  In many ways movement is an important aspect of religion and  spirituality. Not only has the significance of motion within the practice of religion and rituality increased (Coleman & Eade 2004), but also, through the movement and migration of people all over the world, religions and religious practices are relocating and changing (Jenkins 2007).  Movement is significant for the practice of many religions. It seems that motion has been gaining in importance and that the performative expression and execution of religious practice play a stronger part than they used to do. There might be related to the more participative role of believers in religion and rituality and the enhanced relevance of individuals `doing' religion. The popularity of walking the many pilgrim ways through Europe is an example of that trend, while other expressions of movement like dancing, meditations, processions and other rituals also seem to be more in focus.  A second strand of movement is connected to migration for, by moving, people bring faiths and religious practices to other places in the world where they were not previously known or practised. Nowadays, through mass migrations, refugees, displacements because of war and other translocations, religions and beliefs can expand both spatially and quantitatively. These are processes in which the faiths which are moving are being transformed, and the religion(s) of the areas in which people and their religion are newly settled are likewise affected (examples include Islam in Europe and the new Christians from Africa in Europe). Sometimes beliefs are appropriated through tourism or by `spiritual seekers'; aspects of Eastern religion and esoterism have been imported to Western society. In that regard the Internet has become a migratative instrument, in its capacity of `posting' religion all over the globe and into people's homes, regardless of what religion is practised there. The extension of religion through (digital) migration has an impact on social, cultural and political contexts (Woodhead et al. 2002). The movement of religion might lead to an adaptation to new circumstances, to inculturation, but also potentially to a transformation in the religious constituents of the local culture as well. Sometimes there is openness and religion finds new host communities. Evangelical, Pentecostal, neo-Pentecostal churches have spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe (Coleman 2007) and so have Afro-American religions, as Candomblé, Umbanda, or Santeria cubana (Capone 2004; Saraiva 2010). Sometimes the members of the host country become involved in such new practices, but movement may also lead to segregation within host communities and contested situations.  Papers connected to these two research strands on movement and religion are welcomed; one could for example think of the following topics: • The influence of migration on religion • Movement as constituative element in religion and rituality • Effects of globalisation and transnationalism on religion • Changes in religion through digital movement, via the Internet. • Movement and spatiality related to the practice of religion  Format: the conference takes place over two days, followed by an excursion on the third day. Paper presentations are limited to 20 minutes each, followed by ten minutes of discussion. In total 20 paper presenters will be selected. Colleagues who do not present a paper are welcome to participate in the conference and its discussions. A business meeting of the SIEF Working Group on Ethnology of Religion will be held during the conference.  Organizers: the conference is organized by the Department of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology of the University of Szeged together with the Bálint Sándor Institute for Research on Religion and the International Society for Ethnology and Folklore (SIEF). Venue: University of Szeged and Gál Ferenc Theological College of Szeged  Fee: the conference fee is 60 €, including conference materials,  reception, coffee, brunch, excursion.Participants are responsible for travel and accommodation; there is no funding for expenses available. Application: submit an abstract of your paper of maximum 300 words,  together with your name, position, and institutional affiliation to Dr. István Povedák povedak@yahoo.com by March 15, 2012. The selection of the papers will be done in collaboration with the Board of the SIEF Working Group on Ethnology of Religion. The final selection will be communicated by April 1, 2012.

Globalisation, environmental issues and climate change, relationships with Indigenous and creator communities, diversity of audiences, different employee mindsets, new skill sets, new media and technologies and the global financial crisis, have placed increasing pressure on the ways museums are managed and led.
 
The conference will address these issues using a mix of conference/meeting formats designed to encourage conversation, learning, intellectual stimulation and exchange of ideas.
 
CALL FOR PAPERS
 
We warmly invite all interested to send in proposals to present either a
20 minute paper OR a10 minute case study.
 
Your proposal should relate to the overall subject of museum challenges and address one of the following themes. Case studies should address one of the themes, highlight the work of an institution, address a research project or demonstrate a best practice model.
 
1.              21C SKILLS
2.              MUSEUM ISSUES AND MANAGEMENT IN THE PACIFIC RIM
3.              LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
 
Deadline for submission is 31 May 2012.

המועד להגשת תקצירים לוועידת ICME נדחה,"CALL FOR PAPERS - EXTENDED ICOM-ICME/2012/Namibia (ICME Annual Conference 2012) 12-14 September, 2012  & Post-Conference Tour 15-18 September   The submission date for abstracts (see below for details) has been extended to June 15, 2012.  Please note an updated registration form will be posted on the ICOM website, with correct information for payment - http://icme.icom.museum.  Introduction ICME (the International Committee for Museums of Ethnography) is an international committee of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) devoted to ethnography (ethnology, anthropology, folk) museums focusing on local, national and international cultures. ICME is concerned with the challenges facing ethnographic museums and collections in a changing world.   ICME will hold its 2012 annual conference on 12-14 September, at the Safari Court Hotel and Conference Centre, Windhoek, Namibia, in collaboration with the ICOM Namibia. Final details of the ICME conference are forthcoming; the general format of the annual meeting will consist of paper and discussion sessions and excursions to museums and cultural sites in the area. ICME/2012/Namibia will offer a great opportunity to showcase Namibia to an international audience of museum workers  2012 Conference Theme ""Commodifying Culture? Cultural Villages and Living Museums""  Museums are increasingly conscious that many artifacts should not simply be displayed as art. Objects need to be contextualised within the framework of the intangible cultural heritage that provides them with meaning. Ethnographic exhibitions and museums strive to present a context that adds depth to the `reading' of an object and to reflect the dynamic nature of culture. In Namibia and other countries there has been much debate about the best way to `preserve' and `display' culture since it is such a fundamental aspect of a community's identity. How should museums reflect cultural diversity in a way that preserves tradition, but also recognizes the dynamism of living cultures?  On the one hand, museums have sought to develop new exhibitions that have moved beyond the static presentation of objects in glass cabinets using audio-visuals to show the vibrancy of cultural heritage. These new forms of representation also showcase `living tradition' and aspects of continuity and change within traditional rituals, dance, music and oration.   However, another approach presents an alternative format for the preservation and preservation of intangible cultural heritage (in particular). One of the major developments which has transformed the traveller's experience of communities they encounter have been initiatives to create spaces where communities `speak for themselves' and provide musical performances and craft demonstrations to visitors. The initiatives have often labelled themselves as `Cultural Villages' or `Living Museums'. The formula has many variations; critic complain that people at these centres are turned into exhibits, while advocates argue the opposite – that such centres empower communities and provide them with the opportunity to present and preserve their own intangible cultural heritage. The issue also raises questions about the relationship between Museums of Ethnology and the communities that they represent.  Submitting abstracts ICME invites you to submit an abstract for a full paper (20 minutes) addressing the theme of the conference. Abstracts of between 250 and 300 words will be submitted for selection to the ICME Review Committee, chaired by Annette B. Fromm ICME President. Abstracts submitted as attachments should also be included in the text of the abstract in the text of the e-mail itself.  Submissions should be sent to annettefromm@hotmail.com by June 15, 2012. Speakers will be notified by July 1.   The following information should be included with the abstract: - Title of submitted paper - Name(s) of Author(s) - Affiliation(s) & full address(es) - Abstract in English (between 250 and 300 words) - Support equipment required  Collaboration ICME/2012/Namibia will be co-hosted by the ICOM National Committee for Namibia. The National Museum of Namibia, National Heritage Council of Namibia, UNESCO and the Museums Association of Namibia have all been invited to be co-hosts of the Conference.   General conference information Registration forms, registration fee information, hotels, and other details will be forthcoming on the ICME web site - http://icme.icom.museum  Programme During ICME/2012/Namibia, we plan to include several afternoon excursions to sites including:  1) The San exhibition at the Owela Display Centre of the National Museum of Namibia and the large new Independence Memorial Museum, due to be completed by the time of the Conference;  2) Heroes Acre, a national monument on the outskirts of Windhoek;  3) A `Township or City Tour' as `townshop tours' are a new form of cultural tourism that presents urban identities that in some ways confound and in other ways confirm conceptions of ethnic identity.   Venue & Accommodation ICME/2012/Namibia will convene at the Safari Court Hotel and Conference Centre.  The Safari Hotel (3 stars) is holding a block of rooms for participants in ICME/2012/Namibia. All wish to stay there will have to make their own reservations. The Conference Committee is making arrangements for reasonable rates.   Provisional Itinerary for Post-Conference Tour (Program subject to change) A four day post-conference tour will introduce visitors to Namibia, a large and diverse country. Emphasis on the ICME post-conference tour will be on culture, with ample opportunities to view some of Namibia's spectacular scenery and wildlife.   Day One  Bus departs Safari Court Hotel, arrive Omaruru (short walk or tour of Omaruru), Lunch in Omaruru, sleep at Damara Mopane Lodge  Day Two  Visit to Twyfelfontein World Heritage Site. Visit to Burnt Mountain and Petrified Forest. Visit Damara Living Museum, Etosha Safari Camp   Day Three  Drive through Etosha National Park Lunch at Namutoni, , depart Etosha for Oshikoto Lake, followed by drive to Tsumeb. Tour of Helvi Mpingana Kondombolo Cultural Village followed by supper.  Day Four  Tour of Tsumeb Museum followed by drive to Otjiwarongo and Okahandja. Visit Herero graves and Craft Market, Arrive in Windhoek (18:30) Post-Conference Tour Fee 250 Euros (N$2,500.00)  We recommend that participants also consider staying on for an additional few days so that they can take the opportunity to make a visit to the Namib Desert at the coast or the Fish River Canyon. We could provide the contact details of a number of tour operators who could help organise such trips or participants could hire a car as many tourists to Namibia prefer to drive themselves and, thus, have greater control over their time and movements.",06/05/2012 - 12:20,06/05/2012 - 12:20

"הכינוס השנתי של ICR הוועדה המקצועית מטעם איקו""ם למוזאונים אזוריים יתקיים בסרביה, ספטמבר 2012","Invitation and Call for papers Home and Hearth:  Regional Museums and Gastronomic Heritage. 
 
Join colleagues from around the world to discuss documenting, preserving and interpreting tangible and intangible aspects of gastronomic heritage, and contribute your own ""food for thought"".
 
The International Committee for Regional Museums (ICR), ICOM South East Europe Alliance (ICOM SEE), ICOM Serbia and the Regional Museum of Prijepolje invite you to participate in the annual conference to be held 22-29 September 2012 in Belgrade and Prijepolje, Serbia.  The organizers seek presentations and case studies relevant to the theme HOME AND HEARTH:  REGIONAL MUSEUMS AND GASTRONOMIC HERITAGE.  
 
Hearth and home, fireplace and family, warmth and comfort - these are the vital ingredients of social life. Food and the spaces in which it is prepared and served play important parts in family and community life.  The kitchen has changed over time - in some urban contexts today it now resembles a laboratory.  How has technology changed how and where food is prepared and served? What are the unwritten rules regarding food selection, preparation, presentation and consumption?  How have urbanization, immigration and other changes to community and family life affected diet, gastronomy and the material heritage?
 
How do the households of cultural, religious and ethnic groups differ regarding food selection, preparation, presentation and consumption?  What are the unspoken rules, practices, manners?  How are these rules reflected in the material culture and vice versa?  Until recently the types of available foods depended upon geography, but what make one type of animal or grain more desirable than another?  What foods are reserved for festivals and other special occasions?  What special utensils and containers are used to make these foods?  What are museums doing to document and collect these changing practices and technologies? How are the traditions and stories associated with food interpreted for visitors?
 
ICR seeks examples of good practices, successful exhibitions, cooperative activities, community partnerships, events and educational programs which address these questions.
 
Proposals consisting of a title and abstract (summary of up to 200 words) for presentations of 15 minutes and case studies of 10 minutes should be sent by 20 July 2012 to Sue Hanna at sushanna1@aol.com and Rune Holbek at ruh@vaf.no . 
 
Decisions about proposals will be communicated by 27 July 2012. Authors of successful proposals will be asked to provide a written version of their presentation by 5 September 2012 for consideration for publication in the Conference Proceedings.  Papers should be submitted as a Microsoft word document with photos, tables and charts as separate attachments.
 
For additional information go to www.icr-icom.org or contact Sue Hanna, ICR Secretary at sushanna1@aol.com or Rune Holbek, ICR Treasurer at ruh@vaf.no

ICTOP, the ICOM International Committee for the Training of Personnel, invites papers for the ICTOP annual conference to be held in Amsterdam Sept. 13-15 2012. Our meeting this year will be hosted by the Reinwardt Academy for Cultural Heritage, Amsterdam, School of the Arts. This international meeting will focus on the theme of “Bridges and Boundaries: Reframing Professional Education for Museums + Heritage?” We invite proposals for paper presentations of 15 minutes, multi-paper panels, virtual papers by video or other modes of communication, which analyse current and emerging issues in the field of museum professional development.
 
Presentations should examine how professional development education is or is not shifting from a variety of global perspectives and the implications for the conceptualization of our museums/heritage sector and professional preparation.
As an interdisciplinary field, museology/museum studies crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, especially as new needs, emphases and professions emerge. This leaves the boundaries of our profession, its study and delivery unclear at best. But then where and when do we identify new fields for naming our offerings? In some parts of the world, for example, museum studies/museology programs have been extended to include heritage studies in their title or content. The broader term ‘heritage’ may seem like a solution to our vague definitions of the ‘museum’ but does the term ─ and its field ‘heritage studies’ ─ bring more problems than it solves?
Presenters may address how prevalent (or not) this trend is across continents or speak to specific case studies as we reflect on the general implications for the field, other programs and the development of curriculum/a?
§       Is there a genuine shift in concepts and the profession or a pragmatic move that responds to governmental policy and job opportunities? §       What are the challenges for museology programmes, or other developers, in adopting wider definitions such as that of heritage?
§       Are there other tendencies in our pedagogy representing either the voices of traditional or new disciplines ─ such as cultural studies, management, curatorial studies, gallery studies, informatics ─ or emerging topics or issues ─ such as development, sustainability, inclusion, career planning and employability ─ that are compelling changes?
§       Where is the profession in this discussion?
§       What guidelines or competencies might be needed in this complex situation?
 
Program
We will have a mix of
keynotes and parallel paper sessions as well as breaks and lunch sessions over two days Sept. 13-14, and then on the 15th a bus tour outside of Amsterdam, likely to Haarlem.

"מוזאונים לאומיים באירופה המשתנה - כינוס מטעם מכון מחקר Eunamus יתקיים בבודפשט, דצמבר 2012","National Museums in a Changing Europe 12-14 December 2012 Central European University, Budapest  Conference of the Eunamus research consortium studying`National Museums, Identity Politics, the Uses of the Past, and the European Citizen'.   This conference is an opportunity to bring together researchers studying national museums and professionals responsible for taking these institutions forwards. It offers an opportunity to consider the past and present, but with the aim of debating the future. The conference considers holistically the role of the national museum in the context of change.   The conference also welcomes delegates who do not wish to present a paper. To register your interest, please email registration_eunamus_bp@pasts.ceu.hu  The conference will be shaped around the following questions: •How should the institutional inheritance of national museums (purpose, culture, philosophy, etc.) shape their future role? •How do the historical narratives and material collections of national museums contribute to division and contestation? How do they, or might they, build bridges between nations and communities? •How have national museums been instrumentalised in government policy? How have they become socially active? •How do national museums contribute to the values, perceptions and identities of citizens? •In a changing Europe, how can national museums contribute to greater social cohesion? How can the stories national museums tell and the treasures they display, be mobilised to build connections across Europe?  Central to this conference is a dialogue between museum professionals, professional organisations, policy makers and university researchers. While academic researchers can operate outside of the professional and institutional constraints that shape practice, the role of national museums in building greater European cohesion can only be developed within a framework of energetic, proactive professionalism. National Museums in a Changing Europe provides a forum for debate and dialogue between those who study national museums and those who daily shape these institutions and who are charged with taking these institutions forward.  Eunamus, a European-funded research consortium, brings together participants from across Europe to consider how national museums and their uses of the past, might contribute to European cohesion. In 2010, when Eunamus began its research, the challenges to cohesion seemed to arise from population migration, demographic change and nationalism. Two years later, Europe's democratic and economic institutions, and European cooperation more generally, are under extraordinary pressure.  The Eunamus consortium is led by: Peter Aronsson, Linköping University, Sweden; Alexandra Bounia, University of the Aegean, Greece; Arne Bugge Amundsen, University of Oslo, Norway; Constantin Iordachi, Central European University, Hungary; Simon Knell, University of Leicester, UK; Kristin Kuutma, University of Tartu, Estonia; Ilaria Porciani, University of Bologna, Italy; and Dominique Poulot, University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne, France.   http://www.eunamus.eu/firstpage/finalconference.html",04/09/2012 - 10:38,04/09/2012 - 13:37

Los Angeles, Nov. 6-9, 2012
 
DEMHIST, the international ICOM committee for historic house museums, and three ICOM-CC working groups - Sculpture, Polychromy, and Architectural Decoration; Textiles; Wood, Furniture, and Lacquer - are presenting a conference from November 6-9, 2012 in Los Angeles. This four day conference will be co-hosted by the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Research Institute, the University of Southern California School of Architecture/Heritage Conservation Programs, and The Gamble House.
 
The theme of the conference will focus on managing the inevitable deterioration of structure and materials in historic house museums, while balancing the need for public access with current standards of practice in conservation. Historic houses remain in constant use throughout their lifespan and their interiors consist of diverse materials often altering dramatically due to change imposed by society, their environment and function. The proper care for historic houses and their interiors draws from many conservation specializations as well as from many other fields.
Therefore it is essential to approach each project in a holistic manner using a multidisciplinary collaborative approach involving all stakeholders.
 
Papers selected for the upcoming symposium focus on the following key
issues:
 
- The House Museum as a Significant Historic Artifact: How to balance public access with current standards of practice in conservation.
 
- The Artifact Within Its Context: The historic house museum as the setting for the presentation of a collection; meeting the conservation needs of individual objects in the context of an integrated collection and its setting.
 
- Conservation and the ""Narrative"" of the Historic House: How the conservation process and its discoveries can play a role in engaging and educating the public, both in the narrative presented on public tours and by demonstration of conservation techniques to the public.

She established the conservation department at the Science Museum of
Minnesota in 1989. She is the co-author of A Holistic Approach to Museum
Pest Management, a technical leaflet for the American Association for
State and Local History and established a rigorous IPM program for the

conservation section at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh. Ms. Anderson is a member of the American Institute for

קול קורא למשלוח תקצירים - הכינוס האירופי להיסטוריה של מדעי החברה 2014,"CULTURE NETWORK OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY CONFERENCE 2014  Call for Papers / Call for Session Organisers  The European Social Science History Conference (ESSHC)is applauded for its open and interdisciplinary character. The Culture Network welcomes all papers on topics in cultural history, but we especially encourage workshops on: visual culture; media; tourism; architecture and town planning; photography in historical research; cultural diversity and border culture; death culture; collective memory politics; Cold War culture; and utopian visions.  The Culture Network, one of the larger networks within the European Social Science History Conference, invites you to offer a proposal for a paper or a session for the 2014 Conference.   The ESSHC will take place from April 23 up to and including April 26, 2014 in Vienna, Austria. This is an open call. One is free to suggest any theme for the 2014 Conference as long as it relates to cultural history in its broadest sense. Papers stand a better chance of being selected if they fit together with other papers, and the best way to ensure this is to organise a session, or a group of sessions. If someone wishes to do so it will be wise to discuss your proposal beforehand with the Chairs of the Culture Network: Marga Altena, University of Amsterdam, Arts and History Department, NL MargaAltena@hotmail.com Magdalena Elchinova, New Bulgarian University,Department of Anthropology melchinova@hotmail.com Joes Segal, Utrecht University, Department of History, NL j.segal@uu.nl  How to propose a paper: Fill out the pre]registration form on the Internet: http://esshc.socialhistory.org/  Include an abstract of your paper (250]500 words). Please send in your form as soon as possible, but before May 15, 2013 at the latest. No individual may present more than one paper. However, every participant can act as a chair or commentator in addition to presenting a paper. A participant cannot act as chair or commentator in the same session he/she is presenting a paper.  How to organise a session: gather four speakers who each will present a paper on a related topic, a chair, and a commentator who will introduce the discussion with a prepared comment on the papers. The roles of the session organiser, chair and commentator can be fulfilled by the same or by different persons.  Confirm participation and arrange with these individuals the (date of) exchange of papers and the way the session will be conducted. If possible, have one or more substitute speakers at hand in case of withdrawal of one of the speakers. Submit the proposal for a session with a pre]registration form for each individual speaker. The deadline for this is May 15, 2013, but please send your form as early as possible. Contact the speakers regularly to make sure that the preparation is going according to plan.

"קול קורא למשלוח תקצירים לקונגרס הבין-לאומי ה-11 ל-SIEF, אסטוניה, יולי 2013","The call for papers for the 11th International SIEF Congress is now open and will close on 18th January 2013.  The Congress, to be held in Tartu, Estonia, June 30–July 4,2013, is organized in collaboration by the Institute for Cultural Research and Fine Arts at the University of Tartu, Estonian Literary Museum, Estonian National Museum, the Centre of Excellence in Cultural Theory, and the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology at Tallinn University. Congress website: www.siefhome.org.  CONGRESS THEME The SIEF 2013 Congress examines the stakes and implications of circulation and its semantic siblings – flow, exchange, travel, and mobility. As a thematic touchstone for panels and presentations, the Congress theme (http://goo.gl/sSWmo) should be used to help imagine informed and engaging entry points into theory or into current interdisciplinary conversations, while standing on firm ground in ethnology, folkloristics or cultural anthropology.  We are witnessing an unprecedented growth of networks, of new infrastructures and channels that circulate knowledge, expressions, images, and information at previously unthinkable speeds, ranges and intensities. Though ethnologists,folklorists and cultural anthropologists have been thinking and writing about circulation for a century and half, contemporary phenomena call for a renewed interest in how cultural forms and expressions are produced, retained, contested or consumed via these new circuits.  CONGRESS PROGRAMME Following the opening event on June 30, 2013 the programme will run over three full days and comprise sessions with different formats: panel sessions with paper presentations, workshops, poster sessions and a film festival.  Each day of the Congress features two invited keynote speakers. Confirmed keynote speakers include: Michael Herzfeld (Harvard University), Robert G. Howard (University of Wisconsin), Kristin Kuutma (University of Tartu), Joep Leerssen (University of Amsterdam), Alessandro Portelli (Sapienza University of Rome) and Greg Urban (University of Pennsylvania).  In panels, each presenter will be given up to 30 minutes, with a maximum of 20 minutes presenting and 10 minutes for questions / discussion.  Workshops are conceptualized as practical events, guided discussions and free&#8208;format exchanges leading to specific public outputs. They may include elements of performance, exhibition materials, or interactive media displays.  Poster sessions are meant to provide everyone with the opportunity of presenting their work and are aimed at junior scholars in particular. Sessions will run throughout the Congress, with dedicated slots when poster presenters will be available at their respective display to discuss their topic with the colleagues.  The Congress also welcomes ethnographic films. The film screening seeks to provide a forum for those interested in visual representations of anthropological/ethnological knowledge.  SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL Please browse the list of accepted panels and workshops on the Congress website www.nomadit.co.uk/sief/sief2013/panels.php5 and make your proposal to an appropriate panel. All proposals must be made via the online form! Convenors wishing to present in their own panel should also use the online form to enter their proposal.  Proposals should consist of a paper title, a very short abstract of less than 300 characters, and an abstract of 250 words.  Posters and films must confirm to the same basic requirements as outlined for the panel/workshop sessions.  Detailed instructions for submitting proposals and contacting panel convenors are provided on the Congress website where you can also find more information on the film festival.  Please note the following: You may only make one presentation, although you may also convene one panel/workshop and/or act as discussant for one panel/workshop. You may submit multiple proposals; however, this is not encouraged; instead we will attempt to re&#8208;house any papers which were initially rejected by panel/workshop convenors due to lack of space (rather than quality) after the call has closed.  All presenters must be members of SIEF, and have paid their subscription (€20,&#8208;) for 2013 before the conference. However, you may propose a paper before joining. If and when your paper is accepted, non&#8208;members will be asked to sign up.   SIEF is officially trilingual, allowing presentations in English, French and German. Yet it is up to the decision of the panel convenors as to which languages they will accept in their panel/ workshop. In the first instance please contact the convenors of the relevant panel and ask them if they are happy to accept a paper in a language besides English.   Any queries with the above please e&#8208;mail: congress@siefhome.org.  Congress website: www.siefhome.org

CALL FOR PAPERS   ICME/2013/Brasil Annual Conference Rio de Janeiro, Brasil 10-17 August, 2013  ICME (the International Committee for Museums of Ethnography), an international committee of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), will hold its 2013 annual conference on 10-17 August, 2013, as part of the ICOM 23rd General Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.   The theme for the ICOM Triennial is Museums (memory + creativity = social change) - which describes the general notion that museums wish and work to promote change. The mathematical equation inspiring the 23rd General Conference of the International Council of Museums suggests that this work arises from a composition between creative freshness and the memory constructed and entrusted to museums. It is memory activated by creativity in the museum environment reverberating in the society and promoting social change.  (see http://www.icomrio2013.org.br/en/conference-theme)  ICME/2013/Brasil invites papers addressing the following two themes: 1. Focus on Collecting: Contemporary Collecting and Reinterpreting (Older) Collections, a joint session with the ICOM International committees COMCOL and ICMAH, and  2. Curators, Collections, Collaboration:Towards a Global Ethics  Theme 1. Focus on Collecting: Contemporary Collecting for Reinterpreting (Older) Collections. Museum collections have to be constantly interpreted and reinterpreted in order to extend knowledge about the collected objects. It is a long-accepted fact that each museum is defined by its collections, but a contemporary museum offers its visitors much more than the elements of the past. Museums from different disciplines encounter questions of how to give new meaning to objects in interaction with a multicultural community. We ask how can associations between old collections be made with recent society with the help of contemporary collecting?  Some museums have successfully opening a dialogue with their communities or their representatives by relating them to the objects in museum collections. Members of a community have helped to interpret the objects from museum collections, for example, recent temporary exhibitions at the Museum of World Cultures in Gothenburg. A museum may be a form, but it is always determined by how it communication with objects, by the messages it sends. The new ethnographic museum will be able to start the dialogue with different cultures and find numerous issues that connect it with their local features; it will invite its citizens to bring their possessions and tell their stories. It will interpret new events in society through exhibitions in which all social classes will meet and join in dialogue.   Many museums are struggling to display the objects and stories of recent history. We often struggle again academic training to create collections of and write the stories of our own time. What about the museums? Do we handle contemporary history differently compared to, let's say, history of Middle Ages? How can we include recent history to the activities of archaeological, ethnographic, history and other museums?  We invite papers which focus on the notion and practice of contemporary collecting and the reinterpretation of (older) collections as well as upon participative collecting from museum ethnographers, historians, sociologists and others.   Theme 2. Curators, Collections, Collaboration:Towards a Global Ethics  Papers invited for these ICME sessions will address issues in today's ethnography museums from the point of view of curatorial decisions. Who is responsible for creating memories and whose stories are represented in our museums? We invite papers which approach these questions revealing on-going work by museum ethnographers and others to provide global answers.  Submitting abstracts Abstracts of between 250 and 300 words will be submitted for selection to the ICME Review Committee, chaired by Annette B. Fromm. Submissions should be sent to annettefromm@hotmail.com by April 15, 2012. If you send the abstract as attachment, please also include the text of the abstract in the text of the e-mail itself.  The following information should be included with the abstract: - Title of submitted paper - Name(s) of Author(s) - Affiliation(s) & full address(es) - Abstract in English (between 250 and 300 words) - Support equipment required  General conference information Registration forms, registration fee information, hotels, and other details are available on the ICOM 23nd General Conference website -  http://rio2013.icom.museum  Details of the ICME conference will be forthcoming on the ICME web site - http://icme.icom.museum  ICME (the International Committee for Museums of Ethnography) is an international committee of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) devoted to ethnography (ethnology, anthropology, folk) museums focusing on local, national and international cultures.

"איקו""ם תשיק תכנית חדשה במלחמה נגד סחר לא חוקי בחפצי תרבות בכינוס בריו דה ז'נירו, ברזיל","In link with its role as part of the UN group of expert on illicit traffic, and wishing to further contribute to the advancement of the fight against illicit traffic, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) has launched a long-term and innovative instrument: the International Observatory on Illicit Traffic in Cultural Goods. We are happy to inform you that the European Union Programme Prevention of and Fight against Crime (ISEC) of the DG Home Affairs has provided funding for a three-year project, which is in its preliminary stage and will be officially launched at the forthcoming ICOM General Conference in Rio.
 
In response to the absence of centralised statistics and the lack of available valid information on illicit traffic in cultural goods, this Observatory is an ambitious international programme dedicated to monitoring and reporting on the rising trend which the smuggling and illicit trading of cultural assets has become. One of the aims of the Observatory is to provide a comprehensive database of resources to experts and non-professionals:
 
- Organisations and institutions involved (international organisations, NGOs, state administrations, law enforcement agencies, academics and private organisations)
- National and international legal and ethical instruments
- Practical tools, programmes and good practices
- News, case studies, publications, videos, information Websites and blogs
- Glossary and information sheets on the main good practices
 
The project will be developed and managed by ICOM over the course of three years, starting with an information Website, and leading to the publication of a Global Report on illicit traffic, the first of its kind.
 
These innovative tools will represent a great contribution for the dissemination and enhancement of both knowledge and practices in the field, thus fostering public awareness-raising, as well as professional international and cross-sectorial cooperation.
 
In order to involve ICOM’s network as much as possible in the project, we wanted to gather information about National Committees' role and potential activities in the area of the fight against illicit traffic in cultural goods. Therefore, you will find enclosed a short information form that will help us provide the most accurate information on the Observatory’s Website.
 
We are currently busy working on the first version of the web platform and in order to receive as much contents and information we have sent a similar information form to more than 500 identified organisations and institutions worldwide in the field of the fight against illicit traffic in cultural goods.
 
For the duration of the project we will have to conduct several foreign missions to countries which are either specialized in fighting the traffic or particularly exposed to thefts and smuggling. The National Committees of these countries will be contacted again, in due time, prior to each field mission in order to consult them about possible contact persons and other related pertinent information in their country.
 
In case that your National Committee also is involved in the fight against illicit traffic we would be glad to include a Webpage describing its work, as well as technical sheets for your respective resources, standards and/or tools.
 
The presentation page should include your logo, main public references (Website, contact person, address etc.), as well as a short description of your action(s) that help combat illicit traffic in cultural goods in your country/region. Obviously we are only going to publish those contents for which you will give us permission.

In May 2013 the newly redesigned web platform was launched and re-branded as the Virtual Collection of Asian Masterpieces (VCM). The Virtual Collection of Asian Masterpieces is about sharing museum knowledge. Together, the participants share 2,200 Masterpieces of Asian culture online.   More than 120 museums have already contributed a selection of masterpieces from their collections. These finest examples of Asian creativity present compelling images and information and allow the telling of forceful stories. Stories that draw attention to the similarities and differences between civilizations. Stories that enhance mutual understanding of cultural differences and highlight similarities. Stories that stimulate dialogue between peoples and illuminate their histories.  The primary intended uses of the VCM are educational and informational. Evaluation of the uses, strengths and weaknesses of the VCM will be used to prioritize follow-up steps in its development. This will help to point out useful strategies for reaching out to yet other groups of potential users.  http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/index.nhn

אתר אינטרנט חדש על אודות מוצגי תלבושות במוזאונים,"Clothes Tell Stories is an on-line Costume Workbook<http://clothestellstories.com/index.php/stories>, a web-based resource for museums, students and the general public about how to use costume to tell stories. Costume is extremely evocative and always has an immediate appeal in museum exhibitions. Clothes so easily illustrate many kinds of stories because they bring an extremely personal, engaging aspect to our history. ICOM Costume Committee members - expert costume curators and conservators from museums all over the world - are showcasing their expertise on this site. Many aspects of working with historical costume shown here will also intrigue non-specialists.
 
Since many small and/or specialty museums do not have access to personnel trained in working with costume, Clothes Tell Stories can help teach how to store, handle and show costume and accessories. This will not only bring less-known historical costume out in the open, but will contribute to creating valuable new contacts between the general public and ICOM specialists.
 
The site contains Working with clothes, with guidelines to documentation, collecting, terminology, pattern-taking, and much more. Displaying clothes contains descriptions of museums standards for planning exhibitions, mannequins, social media, and more. Telling stories with clothes contains exciting and touching stories told by costume all over the world: Coat for a wounded prince, Lace for an empress, woven legends, Zuzu Angel, Russian underwear, nurses' uniforms, theater costume and many more. See what costume detectives can tell you about historical clothes!

THE NEW ISSUE OF MUSEUM           INTERNATIONAL IS OUT!
 
The latest issue of Museum International, entitled The Role of Museums in a           Changing Society, has just been published. You can access it online here for free with your ICOMMUNITY login and password. This free online           access will expire a month from now, so be sure to take advantage of           the offer while it lasts. To receive the print edition, members can           take out a print subscription at a discounted rate here.
This           issue of Museum International examines the museum’s evolving           role in the face of unprecedented societal change. Authors discuss           how the museum’s social role is being redefined as museums and           cultural institutions seek to address crucial issues such as human           rights, social equality and justice, and reconciliation by involving           the surrounding communities through a variety of outreach activities.
Rethinking           the role of museum professionals in the context of current advances           in research, field experience and technology has become a vital step           in that direction. Articles present examples from Québec, the US and           Cuba, Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa and the Ukraine, among others.
The           content reflects the ever-increasing need for museums to play an           active part in fostering social change around the world.

"מוזאונים ופוליטיקה - הגשת תקצירים לכינוס משותף של איקו""ם רוסיה, איקו""ם גרמניה ואיקו""ם ארה""ב","Museums and Politics
  September 9-12, 2014, Saint-Petersburg, Russia ICOM Russia, ICOM Germany, ICOM USA Joint Conference
 
In the last few years, museums in our countries have changed dramatically and many now have larger social and territorial responsibilities. The preservation and safeguarding of tangible and intangible cultural heritage is considered the most relevant function of museums and should not be neglected. However, contemporary museums have wider goals. They offer public services and social activities, as well as culture and knowledge. They serve new audiences, use new languages and new media. Innovative museums foster public awareness, promote understanding of heritage and offer educational services. They strengthen cultural identities, support social cohesion and develop intercultural mediation - activities which are fundamental in times of crisis. Museums produce public values and improve regional assets in a global world. They provide facilities and resources for local, regional and national communities. They generate not only knowledge and education, but also income and employment. Museums and monuments are among the most appealing factors for the tourism industry, a vital economic sector in all our countries. Investing in museums, their activities and their professionals, is the best way to develop and improve the quality of cultural tourism.
 
During the last decades, museums have become institutions that form identity of cities, countries and nations with a reasonable political impact. At the same time, the funding of museums has undergone a major alteration, facing cuts from public authorities and the need of finding more and more sponsors whose interests complement museum development.
Additionally, museums are increasingly invited to assume and complement educational tasks in the public sector suffering from the training of soft skills and creative competences.
 
Some museums have become more and more influential within their society and the politics in the countries that pay attention to them. Is this growing influence good for museums or not? Could museums become a plaything for politics or should museums use politics to realize their main purposes?
 
During the conference, we would like to explore the following
sub-themes:
 
1.            Museums, foreign policy, international interests and conflicts
*             Museum exchanges as cultural foreign policy
*             Is the process of concentration in the museum landscape
consistent with the requirement for cultural diversity? Do national politics echo the policy of the international agencies?
 
2.            Museum and the ""Making of Memory""
*             Representation of political and contemporary history in museums
*             Museum as the public area, where power shows its public face.
Museum as a forum for civic engagement to encourage activism, civil responsibility, equality, tolerance and concepts of liberty
*             Problems within cultural heritage. Museum exhibits as
""distillation"" of the public nature of the museum. Does politics have power over the museum exhibit? Are museums independent from the politics in their relationships with the public? Should museums collaborate with politics in the area of the history?
*             Museums and the fourth estate
*             Censorship
*             Government politics in a museum sphere
 
3.            Museums as instruments for developing state and society - new
arguments and legitimations
*             Role of the museum in creation of the area and public capital.
Place of the museum in the modern conceptions of the town-planning and development of the territories
*             Museum as a subject of the cultural policy. Principles and
formats of the cooperation between museums and legislature, executive power on different levels; practice and problems
*             Museums and visitors. In the contemporary world, museums should
be welcoming and accessible places for all people
*             Transformation of the social functions of a museum. Museum - is
it a cultural institution, leisure centre, or a multicultural and scientific centre?
*             Museum as a factor in regional development. Regional specificity
and experience in cultural area formation with museum practices
*             Museum as an educational institution
*             Museum as a tourist attraction
*             Museum as a factor of cultural and economic development of the
region
 
4.            Who cares? The responsibility for financing the cultural and
natural heritage between the public and the private sector
*             What is the status quo of museum funding? What are the options
for co-financing museums in different societies with different traditions? How can the basic values and criteria of the museum be secured in face of budget cuts and the idea of profitability of cultural institutions?
*             State programs on preservation and development of culture as
financial support of the development of museums
*             State policy and non-governmental support of museums,
achievements and problems
*             Legal control in the sphere of preservation, State protection of
objects of cultural heritage
*             Problems with cultural heritage preservation, including the
sphere of technique and collections of the company museums
*             Museums, religious organizations and native populations. Should
museums return religious/spiritual objects of cultural value to the religious organizations or native populations? What are the ethical implications?
*             Challenges of museums dependent on different ministries or
departments. Museum as a non-core asset. How to explain the role of museum to the head of the agency or department?
 
The conference languages will be Russian, English and German.
 
The purpose of this joint meeting is to share knowledge and expertise within the museum community. All contributions should be of high quality, originality, clarity, significance and impact and not published elsewhere.

A Message from the President:
NEW DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR ICOM
 
Dear colleagues,
 
It is a pleasure for me to announce that ICOM has a new Director General. The Executive Council of ICOM, in its 127th session, unanimously approved the recommendation of the Selection Committee for a new Director General.
 
The new Director General of ICOM is Dr. Anne-Catherine Robert-Hauglustaine. She will start working for ICOM on 1 May 2014. The interim Director General Mrs. Hanna Pennock will continue until 16 May 2014 in order to assure a smooth transition.
 
Anne-Catherine Robert-Hauglustaine is the elected Treasurer of ICOM and will step back from this position on 30 April. The Executive Council, in its next meeting on 4-5 April, will decide upon a new Treasurer, according to the Statutes.
 
I am very happy with this choice of the Selection Committee, given Anne-Catherine’s experience in developing exhibitions in the field of science museums, her having chaired the International Committee on Exhibition Exchange, her management experience and her knowledge of the French law, as well as the fact that she is a university lecturer in museology at the Sorbonne.
 
You will find her CV and picture on ICOM’s webpage.  
 
Enclosed please find the final report of the Selection Committee as accepted by the Executive Council on 12 December 2013.
 
Best wishes,
 Prof. Dr. Hans-Martin Hinz

"המפגש השנתי של פורום המוזאונים האירופי (EMYA), אסטוניה, מאי 2014","We are delighted to invite you to the European Museum Forum Annual Assembly and European Museum of the Year Award Ceremony 2014, held in Tallinn, Estonia on 14-17 May. During these days, we will have the great pleasure of introducing the best European museums, as well as our diverse cultural heritage. Come and see the excellence of the European museum scene in our professional and friendly atmosphere and take part in the interesting programmes we have prepared.
 
We are starting with Ecult Dialogue Day, with a programme bearing the title Creating the Magic:Matching Culture and IC. The aim is to identify the technological requirements of museums and cultural heritage owners and present existing technology solutions addressing such needs. Panels and the audience will discuss approaches and processes. Join in and explore the possibilities (the programme is free of charge). The Ecultvalue project is supported by the European Union 7th Framework Support Action Programme and the main objective is to encourage cooperation between museums and ICT, since the whole range of new possibilities for development involves synergies between the two sectors.
 
The entire EMYA event is supported by the Ministry of Culture of Estonia and includes partnership with ICOM. We do recommend you not miss the event since it is a wonderful opportunity to see dozens of nominated candidates for the most prestigious European prizes. Inspiring stories, wonderful museums and challenging solutions that museum professionals have found to make their museums shine: a worthwhile place to be.
 
On Saturday morning the European Museum Forum and the Council of Europe are jointly organizing a panel with directors of the past winners of the Council of Europe Museum Prize (2000-2013), and we have also chosen speakers who will address the audience on the International Museum Day theme in cooperation with ICOM.
 
The Award Ceremony will take place on Saturday evening and the night will be long, since on the same day you will be able to experience Annual Museum Night in one the greatest art museums of Europe.
 
You are therefore cordially invited to attend the entire EMYA ceremony and you can find all of the details on the web site http://www.emya2014.eu/

This year’s conference format proposes a unique experience for participants.
 
The programme will unfold over a 4-day tour through the cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Tampere and Mänttä, with conference sessions taking place in some of Finland’s most prominent museums and exhibition centres.
 
This year’s ICEE conference theme– New Museums, New Partners and New Incentives in Exhibition Making and Exchange – aims to encourage a dialogue about the participation of smaller and medium sized museums in the development of international exhibition networks. Conference sessions will explore the benefits and challenges of widening exhibition exchange networks, the unique possibilities of cross-sector co-productions and collaborations, as well as idea of finding inspiration for exhibition development in different worlds—using the theatre as a case study.
 
We are happy to offer a dynamic conference programme featuring a variety of panel presentations, keynote speakers, museum visits, networking events and the ICEE’s ever-popular marketplace of exhibitions forum.

At the conference’s close, the participants proposed the Siena Charter, a document presenting the Italian perspective on the responsibilities of museums towards heritage and its surrounding landscapes.

The Siena Conference was the starting point of discussions within ICOM’s worldwide network on the 2016 theme.  Our aim is that an ICOM Declaration on Museums and Cultural Landscapes be approved in Milan, so that new strategic objectives and programmes may be set for contemporary museums.
 
The Conference’s participants discussed the Siena Charter, the document presenting the Italian view on the responsibilities of museums towards heritage and its surrounding landscapes. We are hoping that in 2015, the annual meetings of ICOM National Committees, International Committees, Affiliated Organisations and Regional Alliances will dedicate part of their agenda to the theme of “Museums and Cultural Landscapes”, comparing visions, experiences and legal contexts and proposing new ideas and approaches. By 2016, at least four different topics will come under discussion.
 
Firstly, the perception of landscape differs from one country to another and is connected with different cultural backgrounds. In some languages, the term landscape does not even exist. ICOM respects cultural diversity and promotes a comprehensive understanding of landscape. Landscape is a multifaceted concept which adds anthropological, social, economic and cultural dimensions to its physical, natural and geographic significance. Landscapes are part of the cultural and natural heritage to be preserved, interpreted and looked after, in their tangible and intangible aspects.
 
Secondly, ICOM would like to highlight the new social and territorial functions of museums. How can museums take responsibility for cultural and environmental heritage and support preservation, as well as knowledge and communication about it? How can museums become centres of interpretation for the places and communities to which they belong?  How can museums disseminate knowledge pertaining to heritage? Museums should be active in the preservation not only of their collections, but of the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage that surrounds them. The skills and resources necessary to do so should be analysed.
 
Thirdly, addressing  the relationships between museums and cultural landscapes offers the opportunity to form new partnerships and networks, and to develop interdisciplinary new approaches. How can we promote effective cooperation between museums, professionals, organisations and institutions?
 
Fourthly, how can museums help planners and politicians promote sustainable development and preserve landscapes while improving tourism without endangering cultural and natural heritage?
 
ICOM’s aim is that a “Declaration of ICOM on Museums and Cultural Landscapes” be approved at the 24th General Conference in Milan, so that new strategic objectives and programmes may be set for contemporary museums.  We plan to identify one hundred innovative museum actions from different countries and cultures, presenting these at the Milan Conference as international best practices.

Emergency Expert Meeting for the           Safeguarding of Iraq's Cultural Heritage
ICOM           was invited to the Emergency Expert Meeting for the Safeguarding of           Iraq's Cultural Heritage, which was organised by UNESCO on Thursday,           17 July, 2014 in Paris, France. This roundtable provided an           opportunity for speakers from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities           of Iraq to assess the damage to cultural heritage in the country and           the needs of Iraqi professionals working in the sector. The Ministry           emphasised the need for international cooperation to effectively           protect cultural objects, which are suffering daily attacks by troops           from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Emergency           response training programmes for Iraqi museum professionals were also           discussed.
The           fight against           illicit trafficking in cultural goods has long           been one of ICOM’s chief priorities. During the meeting, the           importance of the Emergency Red           List of Iraqi Antiquities at Risk was           highlighted, which was the first Red List published by ICOM in 2003,           and remains relevant due to the ongoing looting and illicit           trafficking of cultural goods in the region. The publication is           currently being updated and reprinted with the generous support of           the US Department of State.
During           the technical meeting, ICOM Director General added that ICOM’s           International Observatory on Illicit Traffic in Cultural Goods provides information on the issues of looting and illicit trafficking           and that by filtering searches by country, material on Iraq can be           readily found. The Observatory is an accessible platform that could           eventually be used to efficiently alert the public of violations in           Iraq.
Representatives           of ICCROM, ICOMOS, IFLA, INTERPOL and UNESCO attending the meeting           called for an immediate response to the tragic events taking place in           the northern Mosul region of Iraq for the past several months.           Mobilising the international community is more crucial than ever to           ensure that concrete actions are implemented to fight this threat to           the cultural heritage of Iraq, and the world.

The event focused on the theme New trends in museology and allowed its participants to analyse different currents in the way           museology is defined and to investigate new trends in the museum           field. ICOM France then held           its Annual General Assembly on 20 and 21 June in Nice, France. The           Oceanographic Museum of Monaco welcomed 120 museum professionals for           the event, which included a roundtable on the theme Expositions à sujets           sensibles (Exhibitions on sensitive subjects) and visits           to museums in Monaco and Nice.
 
 
On 7 July, more than 250 museum professionals and           representatives of many Italian and international cultural           associations met in Siena, Italy, for discussions on Museums and Cultural           Landscapes, the theme for the 2016 ICOM General           Conference. The event, organised by ICOM Italy,           Fondazione Musei Senesi and Regione Toscana, included speeches on the           cultural and social role of museums, as well as the organisation and           promotion of ICOM Milano 2016. During the conference, participants           approved the Siena Charter,           a document presenting the Italian perspective on museum’s           responsibilities toward heritage and its surrounding landscapes. ICOM           Italy expects this document to be a starting point for discussions on           the 2016 theme within ICOM’s international network.
 
Meanwhile,           CIMUSET (International           Committee for Museums and Collections of Science and Technology) hosted its 2014 conference at the Musée des arts et métiers in Paris           from 6-11 July. The event focused on the theme Collections,           exhibitions, demonstrations: their usefulness as tools to facilitate           understanding in the museums of science and technology and science           centres. On this occasion, an agreement was signed           between the China Science and Technology Museum, the Conservatoire           national des arts et métiers and ICOM to promote the exchange of best           practices and the training of personnel.
Finally,           ICOM UK held their           Annual General Meeting at the Geffrye Museum in London on 25 July,           inviting Prof. Peter Stone OBE, Director of the International Centre           for Cultural and Heritage Studies at Newcastle University and Chair           of the UK Blue Shield, to talk about heritage at risk in zones of           conflict.

"הרמן ווילם ברינקמן, המזכיר הכללי בדימוס מטעם איקו""ם בשנים 2004-1998 נפטר בתאיילנד","We have learned with deepest sorrow that Herman Willem Brinkman, former Secretary General of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), affectionately known as Manus by his family, friends and colleagues, passed away on 4 July, 2015 in Thailand.
 
Born on 7 January, 1950 in the Netherlands, Manus served as ICOM Secretary General from 1998 to 2004, when he retired to Thailand. During his term as head of the ICOM Secretariat, working with then-ICOM President, Jacques Perot, he was responsible for managing the 19,000 ICOM members around the world, a network that grew and has continued to grow since. He gained prominence as a museum professional in the 1980s, working for the Children's Museum of the Tropenmuseum, Netherlands for a decade, during which he became director of the institution. He was subsequently director of the Dutch Museum Association, prior to joining ICOM. His work notably focused on highly innovative programmes concerning developing countries, racial minorities and disadvantaged communities. Through his involvement in European and international cultural activities, he was elected Chairperson of NEMO (Network of European Museum Organisations) from 1995-1998. As Secretary General of ICOM, Manus fought to counter illicit traffic in cultural property, out of his personal wish to act for the respect, equality and promotion of all cultures. Following his early retirement to join his wife in Thailand, he continued to work as content editor of the Virtual Collection of Asian Masterpieces. The ICOM network was able to rely on his commitment to and understanding of the organisation as a member of the Working Group on Governance throughout 2014.
 
We regret the loss of a unique and extraordinary colleague of the world museum community and express our sincere condolences to Annelie, his wife, to his entire family, and to all of his friends and colleagues. We join Annelie in celebrating Manus's life and sharing the positive outlook that he held through the end of his life: ""Realise what you have, do the things you want to do, cherish it all and don't take anything for granted.""
 
Hans-Martin Hinz, President of ICOM
Anne-Catherine Robert-Hauglustaine, Director General of ICOM ICOM General Secretariat
 
 
Message from Jacques Perot (1998-2004)
The international museum community, and in particular, all of the friends he made at ICOM, are deeply saddened. Manus Brinkman, Secretary General from 1998 to 2004, is no more. A number of personal memories resurface. Personally, I keep the memory of a friend and diligent colleague who was notably able to oversee the structural reforms undertaken by ICOM at the time, and successfully organise two magnificent general conferences in Barcelona and Seoul.
Open to others, he knew how to listen, and his smile stayed etched in your memory. He had many friends around the world and notably in Thailand, where with his wife, Annelie, he spent his last years, ever active and generous. A compassionate and beautiful person has left us, and we would like to let his wife, Annelie, and all of his loved ones know that we share their sorrow in this sad time of goodbyes. Their pain is our pain.

Another         productive meeting of ICOM’s International Observatory on Illicit         Traffic in Cultural Goods
The fourth meeting of the Editorial and Consulting         Committees of ICOM’s International Observatory on Illicit Traffic in         Cultural Goods was held at the ICOM General Secretariat in Paris,         France on 13 and 14 November. Over these two days of discussions,         presentations and working sessions, inside information on the sensitive         situation in Syria was shared, and new technical sheets on best         practices were drawn up, which will be added to the website of the         Observatory.
Launched         in January 2013, the Observatory was conceived at the initiative of         ICOM and with the financial support of the Prevention of and Fight         against Crime Programme of the European Commission’s Directorate-General         Home Affairs. It is the fruit of ICOM’s long-term involvement in the         fight against illicit traffic in cultural property, and serves as a         permanent international cooperative platform and network between         international organisations, law enforcement agencies, research         institutions and other external expert stakeholders. As noted by         Marc-André Haldimann, mediterranean archaeology expert at the Swiss         Federal Office of Culture and associated researcher in Bern University,         who also attended the meeting, the Observatory “is an essential         information exchange platform for experts, facilitating the elaboration         of new solutions.” The main objective of this platform is to build an         extensive information databank for the network and the public through its         website and to publish a Global Report in 2015, the first of its kind,         presenting a range of case studies, statistics, analyses and reference         articles.

ICOM President Hans-Martin Hinz in         Lviv for ICOM Ukraine's annual meeting
ICOM President, Prof. Dr Hans-Martin Hinz, attended the         annual meeting of ICOM Ukraine on November 14 and 15 in Lviv at the         Museum of Ethnography and Applied Arts of Institute of Ethnology of the         National Academy of Science of Ukraine. The conference focused on the         theme: 1914-2014:         from the war of empires to the dialogue of cultures and         gathered Ukrainian scientists, museum managers and politicians.         Different themes such as The         cultural heritage of the border areas: ethnicity and social         responsibility or Actuality         of value of war monuments for society and politics were         discussed during the meeting.
In         his opening speech, Prof. Dr Hinz opened discussion on the conference         theme, in the year of the World War I centennial, declaring that:         “looking back over times of sudden and sometimes stressful social         change, it is notable how often public cultural policy has reacted by         supporting museums in order to strengthen their role in enabling people         to reflect on the many strands that make up the past, and to imagine a         positive future. […] We can perceive in this short outline that         political aspirations and the progress of museums are inevitably         closely connected in the development of nation-states around the world         today.” He also participated in a panel discussion on Cultural heritage: shared         responsibility on the role of museums, public and         governmental institutions in creating shared responsibility for         cultural heritage, along with two other speakers: Dr. Volodymyr         V’atrovych, Director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory and         Dr. Vasyl Rozhko, Head of the Museum Department of the Ministry of         Culture of Ukraine.
Prof.         Dr Hinz was interviewed during his stay, by the Lviv Channel 2 (HTA).         The entire 40-minute interview can be found here in two parts:

Time to start preparing for         International Museum Day 2015!
Join us in celebrating International Museum Day on 18         May, 2015 around the theme Museums         for a sustainable society. This theme is a common         concern throughout the world, and ICOM President Prof. Dr Hans-Martin         Hinz, defines the museum’s role in sustainable development as:
""Museums,         as educators and cultural mediators, are adopting an increasingly vital         role in contributing to the definition and implementation of         sustainable development and practices. […] We must do everything we can         to ensure that museums are part of the cultural driving force for the         sustainable development of the world.""
If         you are already preparing International Museum Day for 2015, ICOM is         keen on providing inspiration for your activities and events to make         the day unforgettable. The Kit for Museums helps you define         your objectives and gives examples of activities that target different         publics.

It provides an overview of all aspects of modern         museum management and is celebrating its ten years in helping museum         professionals. In the early 2000’s, the need was felt to create a         reference document providing guidance for more in-depth study of         particular aspects and giving entry-level professionals an         understanding in the basic aspects of running a museum. Each chapter of         the handbook tackles practical guidelines and entry points for         discussion on various aspects of museum management, such as         ""Caring for the visitor"" or ""Museum security, including         disaster preparedness"". The main text is accompanied by         supplementary information that includes technical data and standards,         suggestions for practical exercises, and discussion topics for training         and other uses. As Alissandra Cummins, former ICOM President, wrote in         her foreword, “this publication is another example of ICOM’s direct         response to the need to provide professional training and practical         advice wherever it is needed. […]Today one of the organisation’s stated         objectives remains to advance ‘the sharing of professional knowledge         and museum practice internationally through mutual assistance,’ while         at the same time actively encouraging new models for collaboration.         ICOM’s key mission after establishing professional and ethical         standards for museum activities is the promotion of training, and the         advancement of knowledge.”
The         ICOM/UNESCO Practical Handbook can be downloaded in English, French, Arabic, Spanish, Russian and Chinese.








 








 








 








ICOM General Director travels to the         84th ICCROM Council in Rome
Earlier         this month, Prof. Dr Anne-Catherine Robert-Hauglustaine attended the 84th Council of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation         and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) in Rome, Italy. She         called for a continued and constructive collaboration between ICOM and         ICCROM, following the statement of cooperation signed in June between         the two institutions “to establish a partnership of excellence to         ensure a better collaboration and training of museum professionals.”
ICCROM,         an intergovernmental organisation representing 133 member states, is         dedicated to the conservation of cultural heritage, with its main areas         of activity focusing on training, information, research, cooperation         and advocacy.
The         collaboration will involve ICOM’s National and International Committees         and the ICOM Secretariat in “shar[ing] and enrich[ing] mutual         expertise” and “encourag[ing] and promot[ing] international         cooperation.” The ICOM Code of         Ethics for Museums is one of main tools         promoted through this important partnership.

"קמוק CAMOC הוועדה מטעם איקו""ם למוזאוני ערים חוגגת עשור במוסקווה, אפריל 2015","CAMOC, ICOM’s International Committee for the Collections and Activities of Museums of Cities was born in Moscow in April 2005 and it is to Moscow we are returning for our tenth anniversary. CAMOC, in collaboration with the Museum of Moscow, is hosting an international conference “Memory and Migration”, a conference on city museums, migrant memory and migrant identity. From the 12th century onwards the capital of Russian has united people of different cultures and histories to create a vast, dynamic and diverse world city.
 
*Memory and Migration *
 
Migrants created cities and they continue to give cities shape and meaning.
We, and our parents, may have been born and brought up in the city, but we are all in one way or another the children of migrants, migrants from the rural hinterland or from another country, who found the lure of the city irresistible.
 
Migrants bring memories of their past, their culture and their habits with them. How do they preserve them in another environment, how do they maintain their identity? They may prefer to be absorbed into their new home, but they still bring a former life with them, and diversity and difference give a city its own unique character. In any event, no city museum can be indifferent to the impact of migration. All this will be at the heart of our conference.
 
Migration is a vital part of urban history and a subject that touches many different points of heritage, legacy and human rights across the world.
Histories of migration are collected and interpreted in many museums and city museums all around the world. Thanks to the flow of migration, cities are continuously changing. And of course social media now have the power to accelerate this change and to create new ‘places’ for discussion on the city.
 
City museums preserve and disseminate a city’s memory, yet at the same time migration continually redefines a city’s heritage and narrative. With this in mind, these are the sessions and themes we are proposing:
 
*Migration and city museums *
 
In this session the focus will be on the role of migrants from the hinterland, near or far, or from another country in giving shape to the unique characteristics of the city throughout its history.
 
* City museums as places of debate and social involvement in the changing
city*
 
How are city museums dealing with migration and memory? What are the issues and the challenges for city museums? What is the potential for city museum involvement? What is the role of migration in the creation, history, culture and development of a city.
 
*City museum as a Memory Centre and a Place of Inclusion *
 
What is memory? Who’s memory does city museum represent? Every place in our cities has both collective and individual memory and each develops different narratives. What is cultural exclusion and who is excluded? Is it possible to escape exclusion and what is to be done? This session will focus on different ways of working with memory.
 
*City Museums – 10 years together *
 
A number of presentations on exciting and original projects in city museums. Does your museum have a project that it is really proud of? Do you think it can be inspiring and interesting for the CAMOC community? Is the topic something many museums around the world are faced with? It is time to present this project to us, sharing efforts, challenges, weaknesses and strengths with colleagues.
 
Our detailed programme, including a full range of receptions and excursions in the city, is now being drawn up, but in the meantime we are inviting you to take an active part in the work of our conference.
 
*To submit a proposal for a presentation:*
 
Please send us an abstract of no more than 350 words, as well as a short biography, to camoc2015conference@gmail.com (contact person Layla Betti, member of the CAMOC’s Executive Board)

50 years later, a new recommendation for museums
 
ICOM  is currently working closely with UNESCO to draft a recommendation to  protect and promote museums and to encourage appreciation of their  diversity and their vital role in society. This joint commitment to  establish standards and principles that will assert the roles and  responsibilities of museums and their place in society first saw light  in 2012, during an international meeting of experts organised by UNESCO  in collaboration with ICOM and IBRAM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The  recommendation takes as its first principle that museums share a number  of missions, such as the dissemination of culture and education and  working towards justice, freedom and peace. They particularly contribute  to establishing a moral and intellectual solidarity among the public,  and to ensuring equal access to education for all.
Considering  the demographic, technological and environmental changes taking place  around the world that affect societies and their relationships with  nature, culture and heritage, this recommendation sets the protection  and promotion of cultural and natural diversity as a major challenge of  the 21st century. Museums, tasked with the role of protecting  the tangible and intangible heritage of human cultures, have become  increasingly popular institutions around the world, notably in the  second half of the 20th century. Given that museums are  spaces of cultural transmission, apprenticeship, discussion and  training, they play a key role in education, social cohesion and  sustainable development. Beyond their role in engaging and being  accessible to the entire public, they also contribute to economic  development, particularly through tourism and the cultural and creative  industries. In line with the professional standards disseminated by  ICOM, this recommendation will clarify the role of museums. It will also  highlight the importance of their protection and promotion, allowing  them to fully contribute to sustainable development and intercultural  dialogue, notably by safeguarding and educating the public about  cultural diversity and heritage.
An  intergovernmental expert meeting devoted to consideration of the draft  recommendation will be held in the UNESCO headquarters on 27 and 28 May,  2015. This meeting will conclude the recommendation project and will  submit it for discussion and possible adoption at the UNESCO General  Conference during its 38th session in september 2015. Since  1960, this is the only international and normative instrument that has  been completely devoted to museums. This tool has been long awaited by  the international museum community.

Preparation for a new workshop at the ICOM-ITC Training Centre in Beijing
 
After the success of the first training workshops held at the Palace Museum in Beijing, China, the ICOM International Training Centre for Museum Studies (ICOM-ITC) has announced that its next workshop will take place from 13 to 21  April, 2015 in Beijing. ICOM-ITC is supported by ICOMâ€™s professional  network in providing a high-quality training programme for Chinese and  international museum professionals, especially ICOM members from  developing countries and the Asia-Pacific region. It officially opened  its doors on 1 July, 2013.
This fourth session of training workshops will be devoted to Exhibitions in museums.  Many internationally renowned experts will give lectures and discuss  exhibition-related issues such as ""the process of creation of an  exhibition"", ""understanding the audience needs"", ""Exhibitions: practice  and accessibility"", ""Evaluating an exhibition"", ""Specific aspects of the  conception of an exhibition"". Chinese experts will also exhibit  projects created in their museums. A session called ""Reading artifacts"",  developed by the Canada Science and Technology Museum, will offer  participants access to objects in the Palace Museumâ€™s collection.  Practical sessions will be celebrated in some of the most renowned  museums in Beijing and an excursion day will enable participants to  visit the most celebrated cultural heritage sites in Beijing and its  surrounding area.

New publications within the ICOM network
ICOM National and International Committees kicked off the New Year by issuing new publications on a variety of topics.
ICME, the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Ethnography, has recently published a new title called Dissolving boundaries: Museological approaches to national, social and cultural issues.  The publication, written in English and German, gathers a series of  articles presented during the committeeâ€™s 2011 Annual Conference, held  in the Monastery of Banz, Germany. Boundaries represent a challenging  topic for museums, whether they be geographical, political, social and  cultural. The publication collects insights and experiences from all  over the world, raising many questions and addressing recurring topics  in museums and ethnography.
More information and access to the publication: http://icom.museum/resources/publications-database/publication/dissolving-boundaries-museological-approaches-to-national-social-and-cultural-issues/ 
CECA, the International Committee for Education and Cultural Action,  has published the conference proceedings of its 2013 Annual Conference  in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was held at the time of the 23rd ICOM General Conference, for which the theme was: Museums (memory + creativity) = social change.
The publication can be consulted here: http://network.icom.museum/ceca/publications/conference-proceedings/
Finally, two ICOM Committees have issued their first newsletters of 2015. CAMOC, the International Committee for the Collections and Activities of Museums of Cities,  notably published a collaborative reflection about the urban network of  the city of Trento, Italy, encouraging its readers and members to think  about a redefinition of the concept of the â€˜museum of the cityâ€™.  Also, ICOM Portugal devoted its latest newsletter to the need for museum  professionals and museums themselves to develop their networks and  share their resources.
The two newsletters can be read via the following links:

MUSEUM INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR PAPERS                                Vol. 67 No. 267-268 - Museums, heritage and capacity building 
ICOM is preparing a double issue of Museum International on the theme Museums, heritage and capacity building.  The issue will be prepared under the direction of the Editorial Board  with Prof. Dr Tereza Scheiner as Editor in Chief. All proposals  submitted will be assessed for suitability and subsequent articles will  go through a peer review process. The issue is expected to be published,  in collaboration with Wiley Blackwell, by March 2016.
Professional  capacity building has been a fundamental aspect of the reflection  undertaken by the museum community since the 1940s. Recent changes in  the knowledge environment and the development of museology as a  discipline have given rise to a series of discussions on the topic on an  international level. The need to specify what exactly transforms a  â€˜museum workerâ€™ into a 'museum professional' led ICOM to define a  wide range of theoretical and practical competencies required, and to  outline the general profile that such professionals must have in  accordance with the organisationâ€™s high ethical standards.
ICOMâ€™s International Committee for the Training of Personnel (ICTOP), created in 1968, has worked to encourage exchange among  professional capacity building programmes. It has also helped ICOM to  define specific ethical standards for museum theory and practice, and to  develop a proactive approach towards the adoption of such standards. In  addition, The Basic Syllabus for the Training of Museum Personnel, formally adopted by ICOM in 1971, influenced the curriculum design of museum studies programmes in many countries.
Museum professionals must have a deep understanding of museum theory and practice and be adequately prepared to work not only in museums, but with museums and heritage, in order to ensure the development of museums and  the protection of world heritage at all levels. The transmission of  inter-generational knowledge and skills, and learning from peers are  vital elements of the learning process. University programmes in  museology and heritage in different regions and at different levels  embody such processes by providing theoretical and practical capacities  in the field.
To adapt to contemporary challenges, museum professionals must simultaneously:          a) recognise the new paradigms of thought that influence museums and the field of museology;  b) increase their ability to act in accordance with such paradigms,  developing discourses and practices that represent the values of  different groups in todayâ€™s society; and  c) develop new forms of connection between museums and society, paving the way for community participation.
These  developments require theoretical knowledge of museology and basic  museum functions, technical competence in applied museology, and an  ethical commitment to society.
To  accomplish the above, museum professionals must be prepared to  re-evaluate the concepts of Heritage and Museum, and to approach such  concepts critically when developing their work.
You  are all invited to contribute to this upcoming issue on the theme of  museums, heritage and capacity building. We hope you will take the  opportunity to offer new perspectives on and approaches to this  fundamental topic for the museum community.
Submission process: Abstracts of between 250 and 300 words, written in English, should be submitted for selection to publications@icom.museum Proposals in other languages unfortunately cannot be considered for publication.
Contributions will be on a voluntary basis.
The submission deadline is 30 April, 2015. 
The following information should be included with the abstract:
â€¢	Title of submitted paper
â€¢	Name(s) of author(s)
â€¢	Professional background

Further information:      For all queries on this Call for Papers, the submission process and guidelines, please contact AedÃ­n Mac Devitt at aedin.macdevitt@icom.museum

"הכינוס השנתי של ICR בשיתוף איקו""ם ישראל יתקיים בירושלים ובתל אביב, אוקטובר 2015 - Call for Papers","Welcome to the ICR 2015 Annual Conference to be held in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israel, on October 19-23, 2015, and organized in cooperation with ICOM Israel. We invite presentations on the conference topic: 
 
“Regional Museums and the Forging of Identities in a Multicultural Society”
 
As the nations of the world progressively develop into multiethnic and multicultural societies, regional museums should reflect on the role they can play in this process. Whether or not their host nations are developed or developing countries, museums must consider how they can aid in satisfying their public’s needs and desires for multiple and varied identities.
 
The ICR Israel 2015 Conference will address this broad area in relation to the concerns and activities of regional museums through questions such as those suggested below:
•             How are viable identities forged in multiethnic/multicultural societies? 
•             What effect do tensions between traditional societies and the modern global society have on viable identities?
•             Should regional museums play an active part in relieving such tensions?
•             Do they do so already, and how?
•             How should museum narratives be organized in multiethnic/multicultural societies?
•             Which resources can best be utilized in such efforts? 
•             How can these processes reflect societal changes?
•             Should regional museums attempt to influence these processes or should they simply reflect them?
•             Can regional museums provide sufficient support for the forging of identities?
 
Presentations of Papers:
 
Presentations are limited to 15 minutes and must be delivered in English. Since no translation services will be provided, the presentation text must be easy for an international audience to follow.

"הכינוס השנתי של איקמה יתקיים בהאנוי, וייטנאם, אוקטובר 2015","ICME 2015 Annual Conference, 25-26 October 2015, Hanoi-Vietnam
 
Museums and Communities: Diversity, Dialogue, Collaboration 
 
This conference addresses the contemporary museum’s concern with power, representation and affect. Specifically, conference considers the transformation of exhibition spaces from sites where knowledge is transmitted to passive audiences towards potential contact zones or forums where diverse community voices and visibilities are raised and new knowledge(s) actively constructed in on-going dialogue.
 
We are calling for papers to consider this broad theme from a number of angles as a major interest lies in the creativity of disciplinary and spatial border crossings. This conference raises a number of questions, which in one way or another have been vital considerations at ICME’s conferences over the years.
How can we reinterpret and reimagine historical collections, together with source communities to engage diverse new audiences? What new collaborative ways of working with material culture and the intangible heritage from which it emerges might enhance the social value of museums?
 
Is social media and technology helpful to museums intent on engaging diverse audiences? Can technological innovations contribute to more genuinely inclusive engagement? Does technology and interactivity detract from the aura of the real? Are traditional curatorial skills, knowledge and indeed posts put at risk by the ‘turn’ towards new media and audiences?
 
How might community perspectives and diverse new voices be integrated into curatorial practice in substantive ways? Can museums and communities partnerships promote genuine intercultural understanding in place of fearful stereotype? Is it possible that new collaborations might enable museum collections, often established in colonial times with all the ‘difficult histories’ of this heritage, be reemployed to progress a more positive future? What fresh collaborative relationships with artists, source communities and local communities may be seen to enhance understandings of ‘us’ and ‘them’ in the frontier zone of ‘both-and’ that lies beyond restrictive ‘either-or’ binary oppositions.
 
We warmly invite your contributions to the ICME annual conference, Museums and Communities: Diversity and Dialogue in Vietnam. Reflecting on what a museum is (and may be) in the twenty-first century, opens up the potential role for developing more cohesive communities, working with similarities – ties that bind humanity – while perceiving differences as strengths. Please join us!

Did you know? 
Twenty-two years ago, in September 1993, ICOM held a             workshop in Arusha on the illicit traffic of cultural property.             Organised as part of a programme bringing together museum             professionals, police and customs officials, the workshop aimed to             establish regional collaboration and to significantly reduce             illicit trafficking. The workshop produced the Arusha Appeal, in which             heritage professionals laid out the priorities for a policy aimed             at effectively fighting this scourge.

ICOM's           annual conferences are in full swing

After a packed month of September, with annual           meetings and conferences held all over the world by national and           international committees, the month of October promises to be just as           eventful for the ICOM community.
The month kicks off with an International Committee           for Architecture and Museum Techniques (ICAMT) conference from 8 to 10 October on ""Norwegian           Narratives – from post-war poverty to international acclaim"" in           Trondheim, Norway. Then the members of the International Committee           for the Training of Personnel (ICTOP) will gather in           Georgetown, Barbados for a meeting on ""Professional Development           in Caribbean Society: Adapting to New Realities"" from 14 to 17           October. The Committee for Museums and Collections of Natural History           (NATHIST) will then hold its annual meeting on the topic of           ""Natural History Museums: Building our Future"" from 19 to           23 October in Taipei, Taiwan, while the members of the International           Committee for Regional Museums (ICR) will be meeting in Tel Aviv, Israel to discuss the           International Museum Day 2015 theme of ""Museums for a           Sustainable Society."" Meanwhile, the International Committee for           Historic House Museums (DEMHIST) will be gathering in Mexico City for a meeting on           ""The legacy of House Museums promoting dialogue among           Generations.""
The International Committee for Marketing and Public           Relations (MPR) will then hold its annual meeting from 24 to 28           October in Yerevan, Armenia on the topic of ""Emerging           Trends,"" while the International Committee for Museums and           Collections of Ethnography (ICME) will be meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam for a conference           on ""Museums and Communities: Diversity, Dialogue,           Collaboration."" The international Committee for museum security           (ICMS) will also gather in Asia, in Zhengzhou, China, from           19 to 23 October 2015.
Finally, members of the International Committee for           Collecting (COMCOL) will meet in Seoul, South Korea from 26 to 31           October at the National Folk Museum of Korea to discuss the topic           ""Collecting & Collections – the politics and praxis of           social, economic and intellectual stability."" The International           Committee for Museum Management (INTERCOM) will round out the month in Washington, D.C. with a           conference on sustainable museum management.
During the month of September, several national and           international committees broadcast their conferences live on social           media, which was a great success among Twitter users interested in           cultural heritage and museums.
Most of the conferences mentioned above will also be           live-tweeting using the following hashtags: #ICTOP15, #ICOMdemhist15,           #ICOMnathist15, #ICOMmpr15, #COMCOL15 and #INTERCOM15. Keep up with           ICOM network events and activities and live-tweet hashtags by           following ICOM at @IcomOfficiel.

קול קורא: לקראת יום עיון בנושא מוזאולוגיה יהודית: פוליטיקה ותצוגה,"CALL FOR PAPERS
Jewish Museologies and the Politics of Display
13-14 March 2016, Centre for Jewish Studies, University of Leeds
Supported by a grant from the European Association for Jewish Studies Conference Grant Programme
Confirmed speakers: 
Felicitas Heimann-Jelinek (Association of European Jewish Museums, Amsterdam/Vienna)
Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Warsaw)
Cilly Kugelman (Jewish Museum, Berlin)
 
A two-day international symposium is to explore the critical debates about Jewish museologies in the light of

a) Jewish institutions and
b) Jewish presences in non-Jewish museums (city      museums, national museums, specialist museums);

 
The conference will include panels on current museum developments in Germany, Central-Eastern Europe, Western Europe (continental), UK/Ireland. The meeting will include a workshop on current local/grassroots archival and heritage collecting and research, including community engagement.
 
In the wake of the opening of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, the first major museum of Jewish history in an East-Central European capital in over a century, this conference aims to reassess the diversity of Jewish museologies in post-WWII Europe, as well as in the context the UK/Ireland, as developments are taking place in Leeds, Manchester and elsewhere. These developments, decentralised as they are, raise questions about what Jewish museology should be and can be: a museology of celebration or commemoration? A history lesson or an encounter with art and aesthetics?
 
In addition, the conference will address specific issues relating to Jewish museums and Jewish history in museums in the UK and Ireland in a European context.
As debates on the musealisation of Jewish history / culture proliferate, this conference will engage international curators and scholars to address some of the following questions:

Are there commonalities among Jewish museums in Europe?
What are these museums and exhibitions trying to      achieve?
How do they construct and involve their stakeholders?
How do they engage with the political discourses that      shape their societies?
Is a dividing line emerging between museums in      countries directly affected by the Holocaust and others not directly      affected?
What research is needed, and has become possible as      archival resources become available and laws change?
With new challenges arising in living in a Europe      increasingly divided about its asylum policies and vulnerable to extremist      violence, what museological reorientations may be needed?

 
Please propose a topic and provide an abstract for a 20 minute paper by email to Eva Frojmovic at clsef@leeds.ac.uk

International museum festival “Intermuseum 2016” will take place in Moscow, Russia, from 13th till 16th of May 2016.
 
 
“Intermuseum” is a greatest museum event in Russia which is held annually presenting a unique cultural space for the exchange of best practices and innovative ideas within the museum expert community, as well as for the promotion and popularization of museum activities and projects among the general public.
 
 
In 2016, the Festival is devoted to the theme - “Social Mission of the Museum in the Context of Intercultural Dialogue”. It will be held with the goal to highlight the role of the museum as an important instrument of social inclusion and cohesion, symbolically named ""Museum without Borders"".
 
 
The Festival will bring together more than 300 museums of Russia and foreign countries in the Manezh Central Exhibition Hall (Manezhnaya Square, 1, Moscow 125009). Traditionally, the structure of the ""Intermuseum""

*MUSEUM WITHOUT BORDERS. SOCIAL MISSION OF THE MUSEUM IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE*
 
 
Museum is one of the most accessible public institutions, which safeguards and popularizes tangible and intangible cultural and natural heritage. By preserving the past, museums strengthen cultural identities, support social cohesion and serve as mediators in the sphere of intercultural communication. Museums around the world cease to be conservative institutions, designed solely to conserve heritage; nowadays individuals with all their aspirations and needs are in the center of the museum’s attention. The visitor is more involved in the museum activities, and museum pays an increased attention to issues of sustainable development.
The museum becomes a socially responsible organization working with various social groups. This new role of museums is emphasized in the UNESCO “Recommendation Concerning the Protection and Promotion of Museums and Collections, their Diversity and their Role in Society”. “Museums are vital public spaces that should address all of society and can therefore play an important role in the development of social ties and cohesion, building citizenship, and reflecting on collective identities”[1] <#_ftn1>

This inaugural workshop for the Migration: Cities           project will explore the impact of the influx of migrants on           contemporary cities, ranging from polarisation and exclusion to           enrichment and the creation of new cultural resources, and the roles           museums can have in collecting, presenting and collaborating in these           processes. The workshop aims to bring together museum professionals,           NGO representatives, psychologists, social workers, specialists in           intercultural education and (im)migrants, who will exchange ideas in           an interactive way.

A RED LIST OF WEST AFRICAN CULTURAL         OBJECTS AT RISK
 
 
In         response to the conflict in Mali in 2012, and in order to fight the         looting of West African cultural heritage, ICOM has published a Red List of West African         Cultural Objects at Risk, including a Mali         ""Emergency"" section, which it released on 16 December 2016 in         Bamako.
The         Red List of West African Cultural Objects at Risk aims to highlight the         types of artefacts that are in demand on the art and antiquities         market, protected by legislation, and vulnerable to being looted,         stolen or illegally exported.
This         publication was made possible thanks to the support of the Swiss         Federal Department of Home Affairs, the West African Economic and         Monetary Union (UEMOA) and the U.S. Department of State.
“With         the complexity of the antiquity market that is shrouded in secrecy,         given the illegitimate movement of the art pieces, ICOM hopes that         potential buyers would begin to demand for provenance before buying         art.” The Guardian,         8 January 2017

In this time of fundamental social change, what is the role of the museum, both as a creature of that change, and perhaps also as an agent of change?
We invite proposals for paper presentations, workshops/interactive sessions, posters/exhibits, colloquia, virtual posters, or virtual lightning talks. The conference features research addressing the annual themes and the 2017 Special Focus: ""Diaspora, Integration and Museums.""
Submit your proposal by 15 February 2017

sponsored by the U.S. Chapter of the Association of Critical Heritage Studies, the meeting Connecting (to) Heritage Studies in the U.S. will be held June 15-18th 2017 at Arkansas State University (Jonesboro, Arkansas). The meeting, composed of both roundtable and regular paper sessions, seeks to further develop an interdisciplinary community in the U.S. that is interested and/or already involved in cultural heritage related work. The meeting will convene scholars, professionals, and students from a diversity of fields, disciplines, and sectors around the concept and uses of ‘cultural heritage’ and potential connections that can be made to the thriving international heritage discourse, the discipline of heritage studies, and to each other. Participants will give presentations and help foster discussions on topics such as: Connecting to Heritage Studies: Theory and Practice, which will convene scholars and practitioners in anthropology, applied anthropology, archaeology, folklore and public folklore, ethnomusicology, museum, library and archive studies, cultural policy, public health, and environmental studies, among others; Heritage Studies and University Programs; Universities and Community Partnerships; Heritage and Media; and Intangible Cultural Heritage.

President's             Message












 












Dear ACHS Member,  Borders, it seems, have come to the fore again.  I'm sure             many of you have stared at your screens this past week bewildered             at what's going on in the United States. In these frantic days of             signatures and protests about entry visas and the construction of a             wall, borders have become the immediate focus of a charged and             volatile struggle over rights, identities and national futures. In             a new Trump era, airports and concrete once again speak to a desire             for protection and security, in ways that undermine respect, reject             difference, repel the foreign, and offer a seeming resolution to             fear. It’s clear that the forms of nationalism, which seek             assurance through increasingly rigid and policed frontiers will             continue to define the politics of western liberal democracies in             2017, particularly in the Anglophone sphere. In stark contrast,             China is busy building trade, infrastructure and cultural links             across borders in its ‘Belt and Road’ ambitions to create an             interconnected Asia for the 21st Century.  It’s within such contexts and changing times that I am pleased to             announce our highly topical and timely conference Heritage Across             Borders, hosted by Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 1-6th             September, 2018. We are now opening the Call for Session Proposals             - and welcome proposals that use the theme of borders in             imaginative and open ways. As the Sub Themes in the Call for             Sessions indicate, working with, through, across and along borders             can help us rethink and challenge some of the key analytical             categories and boundaries that shape discussions of heritage today.             What is the future of heritage, and for that matter heritage             studies, in this shifting world order? What disciplinary boundaries             do we need to cross to grasp the complexities of today?  This first newsletter of 2017 also gives you links to recent book             reviews by ACHS members, details about a new Early Career             Researchers Network for the Association, Chapter news and updates             on jobs, conferences etc. As of last month, the Association has over             2,000 members and some upcoming announcements will provide details             of events planned for this year.  Finally, I would just like to thank the team at Zhejiang University             for their efforts in getting this exciting conference off the             ground. We look forward to receiving your Session Proposals in the             lead up to the March 31st deadline. After that a separate Call For             Papers will be announced.  Best,  Tim Winter, ACHS President

TWO-DAY WORKING MEETING             WITH INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ON FIGHTING ILLICIT TRAFFIC  Putting             into practice our on-going advocacy to promote increased effective             international cooperation and the transnational exchange of             information, ICOM organised a two-day working meetinAg to talk about             existing and future practical tools in the identification of             trafficked art and heritage. 
Thanks to the active participation of a select group             of experts from INTERPOL,             the World Customs Organisation, UNESCO, French, Italian and Spanish             police forces, NGOs and academics, we were able to             clearly identify new areas of development for the ICOM Red List of             Cultural Objects at Risk series. We are grateful to be able to             count on the cooperation of dedicated professionals willing to             support the successful work of the world museum community in its             continuous efforts to protect cultural heritage.
Thanks to the support of             the French Ministry of Culture, a second working meeting with a             different group of experts will take place this month to wrap up             consultations on the use of the Red Lists; its conclusions will             serve as a basis for the future online Red List tool. 
With 16             ICOM Red Lists concerning close to 40 countries, it             is easy to imagine how many illicitly trafficked objects could be             seized should the Lists be used consistently by dealers and             collectors, as well as by law enforcement officials at the world’s             largest ports of entry. New lists are currently being developed,             namely for Yemen and Southeast Europe.

[TRAINING] NEW COURSES OFFERED BY           ICOM SWITZERLAND – March 2017
Sharing and highlighting archive collections  In additional to the actual work of archiving, archive managers are           also being asked to share their collections. Highlighting documents           requires new communication, exhibition and cultural mediation skills.           In partnership with the Association of Swiss Archivists, ICOM           Switzerland is offering for the first time in 2017 a course           specifically designed for German- and French-speaking archivists.
Project           management for exhibitions Project management can create fertile ground for creation and           innovation when teams in charge of exhibitions fully embrace the           approach. In a world where efficiency is becoming increasingly           important to museums, this course offers an introduction to tools           that can be used to coordinate the work of a multidisciplinary team,           plan several phases in a project, and stick to a budget.

READY TO CELEBRATE INTERNATIONAL           MUSEUM DAY 2017?
 
 
 
The           month of May is time for the annual celebration of International Museum Day,           a highly anticipated event for the global museum community. It has           always been celebrated on 18 May, but organisers can decide on the           duration of the festivities: an hour, a night or an entire week –           everyone can place museums in the spotlight as they best see fit.
This           year, the theme of International Museum Day is Museums and contested           histories: Saying the unspeakable in museums. To           help participants address this particularly sensitive subject, ICOM           has formed a scientific panel of leading experts in the field. Visit           the event’s Facebook page to see their contributions, which we'll be           publishing regularly.
http://imd.icom.museum
On           the Facebook page, you can also find articles, suggestions for           activities, videos and pictures you can share, and more.

COMMUNICATING THE MUSEUM PARIS
 
 
 
 
Since           2000, Communicating the Museum (CTM) is the world’s leading arts           communications conference. Each year we gather communications           professionals in a new cultural city.
Agenda           organizes inspiring keynote speeches, engaging panel discussions and           thought-provoking learning sessions addressing the latest trends in           brand communications and digital strategies for the cultural sector.           The event is widely recognized as a rare opportunity for peers from           across the globe to meet, exchange ideas and be inspired by experts.           After 17 years visiting some of the world’s greatest cities (New           York, Sydney, Stockholm, Venice, Istanbul and many others), CTM is           delighted to be returning home to Paris for its 18th edition.
The           theme of this edition of Communicating the Museum is “The Power of Education”.           Over four days, from 19 to 22 June at the Louvre and Grand Palais,           Paris, 300 museum professionals will debate the changing role of           education today, discussing new ideas and forging lasting           partnerships.
50           speakers from over 15 countries will address the following questions:           What are the new trends in museum learning? What should museums be           doing about today’s most urgent political issues? How can each museum           best serve the needs of its communities? How can you get educators,           curators, and communicators to work together? What can museums learn           from their public?
ICOM           is a partner of Communicating the Museum Paris.

Today, professional           communication for museums is based on unique content, perfect formats           and social framing. Marketing of museums in the future will have to           be even more closely linked to location marketing (place, city,           region, nation). MPR is accepting paper proposals for its 2017           conference by email: icommprsubmissions@gmail.com before 21           April, 2017. http://mpr.icom.museum

The event is widely recognized as a rare opportunity for peers from           across the globe to meet, exchange ideas and be inspired by experts.           After 17 years visiting some of the world’s greatest cities (New           York, Sydney, Stockholm, Venice, Istanbul and many others), CTM is           delighted to be returning home to Paris for its 18th edition.
The           theme of this edition of Communicating the Museum is “The Power of Education”.           Over four days, from 19 to 22 June at the Louvre and Grand Palais,           Paris, 300 museum professionals will debate the changing role of           education today, discussing new ideas and forging lasting           partnerships.
50           speakers from over 15 countries will address the following questions:           What are the new trends in museum learning? What should museums be           doing about today’s most urgent political issues? How can each museum           best serve the needs of its communities? How can you get educators,           curators, and communicators to work together? What can museums learn           from their public?
ICOM           is a partner of Communicating the Museum Paris.

Today, professional           communication for museums is based on unique content, perfect formats           and social framing. Marketing of museums in the future will have to           be even more closely linked to location marketing (place, city,           region, nation).

Collections are at the heart of museums. As their core and basis, NEMO wants to take an open look at how museums operate with their collections nowadays. How do museums make their heart beat, how do they connect to other organs in the museum-body, to communities and to society?
We'll examine this question together with museum experts from all over Europe, who will present great ideas and best practices from contemporary collecting, and discuss the political and social effect museums can have on their environment in a digital and diverse society. Explore the programme here!

פעיל אבוריג'יני מאוסטרליה דורש מהבריטיש מיוזאום בחזרה מגן שהיה שייך לאבות אבותיו,"On Sunday, with help from the theatrical protest group BP Or Not BP?, Rodney Kelly appealed to the public for the return of the Gweagal shield.
 
LONDON — Yesterday, Australian Aboriginal rights activist Rodney Kelly visited the British Museum to demand the return of an artifact with a potent history: the Gweagal shield. The shield belonged to Kelly’s great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Cooman, and was seized in 1770 by Captain James Cook during the first encounter between the British and Indigenous Australians. It was later given to the British Museum. The bark shield bears a bullet hole, marking the first shot fired in the long history of violence toward the continent’s Indigenous people.
 
Kelly, who has been campaigning for the shield’s return to Australia, visited the BM yesterday to hold a series of unsanctioned “rebel lectures” aiming to expose the shield’s history, discuss other ill-gotten items in the museum’s collection, and explain — with support from theatrical protest group BP Or Not BP? — why oil giant BP is an unacceptable sponsor for the museum. The group says the energy giant’s sponsorship “effectively brands all the artifacts in the museum with the logo of this destructive company.” The museum signed a new five-year sponsorship deal with BP in 2016.",25/06/2017 - 10:22,25/06/2017 - 10:22

CIDOC SUMMER           SCHOOL
18 –           21 July, Lubbock, US
The CIDOC           Summer School is back this year for a new edition. The International           Committee for Documentation (CIDOC), in partnership with the Museum           of Texas Tech University (MoTTU), established the CIDOC Training           Association in 2011, which organises the yearly summer school           “Principles and practice of museum documentation”. The programme           mixes basic, intermediate and advanced topics, which makes it ideal           for both experienced museum professionals as well as newcomers to the           field. The collaboration between CIDOC and MoTTU brings together           museum experts, from professionals to academics, whose aim is to           educate the participants in the good practices of documentation.           Several hundred museum professionals have already participated in the           summer school. Registration will be open until 17 July 24:00 CST.

ICOM FRANCE           ANNUAL MEETING
29 –           30 September, Musée des Confluences de Lyon, France  For its Annual Conference, ICOM France will tackle the topic “Between           collections and publics: the narration in the exhibition”. Through           the meeting, participants will try to answer a crucial question for           museums of the 21st century: how can we make collections           as lively as the events surrounding them?  Today museums attract           visitors by proposing an increasingly diverse offer: from live           performances to special events and shops or cafés, becoming spaces           where the temporary is intertwined with the permanent and the           entertaining with the scientific. The topic will be discussed through           presentations, a round-table and two workshops.

ICOM E-NEWSLETTER NOVEMBER 2017












 













18th           May 2018 INTERNATIONAL           MUSEUM DAY Hyperconnected           Museums: New Approaches, New Publics
  In an increasingly connected world, it is impossible to understand           the role of museums without considering all the connections they           make. They are an inherent part of their local communities, cultural           landscape and natural environment. Technology allows museums to reach           beyond their core audience through something as simple as a hashtag.           For some museums, technology is not even required to establish new           connections – to approach their collection in a new, innovative way           is enough to attract new audience. On International Museum Day 2018,           museums all over the world will be encouraged to find new approaches           and new audiences by exploring, strengthening and creating           connections.  Stay tuned           for details in the coming months!








 

















 













CAMOC: museum cities and contested urban stories
 The International Committee for Museums of Cities (CAMOC) 13th Annual           Conference will be held in Mexico City from the 30th to the 31st of           October. The main theme of the conference will be Museums of Cities and           Contested Urban Histories, continuing with the spirit           of ICOM’s International Museum Day theme for 2017, Museums and           Contested Histories: Saying the Unspeakable in Museums. The           conference will address issues such as controversial histories,           post-colonial identities and interpretations of urban history. The           participants will also analyse city museums as sites that uphold           respect for humain beings, and the inclusion and coexistence of           all people - including immigrants who live in every city of the           world.   Read more








 

















 













CIMUSET  Technical           Heritage and Cultural Identity
 The 45th Annual Meeting of the International Committee           for Museums of Science & Technology (CIMUSET) will take place in           Rabat, Morocco, from the 5th to the 8th of December. This conference focuses on the           theme, ‘Technical Heritage & Cultural Identity’., the meeting,           which will take place for the first time in an African country, is an           opportunity to reflect on how industrial heritage is perceived as a           part of a nation’s cultural heritage, particularly in the light of           the paradoxical destruction of historical industrial sites           because of industrialisation. Another important theme broached in the           conference is how industrial constructions built by colonial powers           following military occupation can be included in the cultural           identity of the invaded nations.   Read more
